# Product overview

HCL Digital Experience (DX) is the trusted solution for an enterprise's digital experience at the intersection of processes, content, and applications. HCL DX is designed to build more than just websites. It is built cloud native to serve your customers, employees, and partners and to deliver the capabilities and stability that they need and expect.

You can customize HCL DX to meet the needs of your organization, users, and user groups. You can adapt the look and feel of the site to fit your organization’s standards and to customize page content for users and groups according to business rules and user profiles. Users, such as business partners, customers, or employees, can further customize their own views of the sites, as permitted. Users can add applications to pages and arrange them as they want. By aggregating portlets in one place and giving users the power to customize their own desktops, HCL DX users can do business efficiently and with high satisfaction.
