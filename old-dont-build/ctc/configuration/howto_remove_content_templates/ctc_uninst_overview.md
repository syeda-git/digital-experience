# How to remove Content Template

The procedure for removing Content Template Catalog varies depending on which components you installed, if you installed it on virtual portals, and if you added your own pages or templates.

-   **[Removing the Content Template from virtual portals](../ctc/ctc_uninst_virtual.md)**  
If you installed any virtual portals with the properties CTC\_DEMO or CTC\_TEMPLATES set as true, follow these instructions to remove the CTC Demo site and page templates from your virtual portals.
-   **[Removing the Content Template from the base portal](../ctc/ctc_uninst_core.md)**  
Removing Content Template Catalog core components and assembly is part of the uninstallation process. Follow these steps to remove the Content Template from the base portal.
-   **[How to delete the CTC Multilingual Demo libraries](../ctc/ctc_uninst_mls.md)**  
Uninstallation does not delete the CTC Multilingual Demo libraries automatically. These libraries must be manually deleted.
-   **[Deleting the Content Template libraries](../ctc/ctc_uninst_lib.md)**  
Uninstallation does not delete the Content Template Catalog libraries automatically. Attempting to delete libraries fails if other libraries have been created with Content Template content.
-   **[Deleting pages and page templates created when using Content Template Catalog](../ctc/ctc_uninst_pages.md)**  
The uninstall process deletes the page templates, portlets, and demo pages added by Content Template Catalog, but does not delete any pages and page templates you created yourself.
