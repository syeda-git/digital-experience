# Deleting the Content Template libraries

Uninstallation does not delete the Content Template Catalog libraries automatically. Attempting to delete libraries fails if other libraries have been created with Content Template content.

You must either remove the Internet and Intranet site templates within Site Builder before attempting to remove these libraries.

Delete the Content Template Libraries manually in the following order:

1.  CTC Demo Library and any Libraries with content created with the Content Template Templates
2.  CTC Content Library
3.  CTC Design Library
4.  CTC Process Library

**Note:** These libraries must be deleted from both the base portal, and from any related virtual portals.
