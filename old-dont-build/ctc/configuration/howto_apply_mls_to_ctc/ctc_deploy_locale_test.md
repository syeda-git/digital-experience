# Testing multilingual support

With two locales set up, you can test the end-to-end multilingual solution.

Follow these steps to test two locales before adding any more.

1.  Test the creation and publishing of content in the two locales.

2.  Test the rendering of content and language switching in the two locales.

3.  Test the other management functions like delete and move in the two locales.


You might need to modify and test a few times to ensure that the locales are working as expected. When you know your multi-locale site is sound, you can add more locales. From this point on, the multi-locale solution workflows synchronize content across locales.

If you have more locales to create, add them one at a time, repeating the process for rolling out and testing each one.
