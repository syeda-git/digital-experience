# Building the base locale site

The Multilingual Solution is built around the concept of a base locale where content is created first, before being copied and translated or otherwise prepared for other locales.

The first step to creating a multilingual site is to create a "skeleton" site in your base locale:

1.  If your base locale is English, the content in the CTC Content library will not need to be modified. For any other base locale language, translate the content first.

2.  Create a site by using the Content Template Catalog page templates.

3.  Add portlets for the CTC palette, or custom portlets.


You now have a site with which to proceed with the rest of the process.
