# Breadcrumbs and top-level site areas

This step applies to 3.x to 4.4 and 4.0 to 4.4 upgrades only. Breadcrumbs were updated in Content Template version 4.1 to display navigation from the top-level down, and to also recognize the Hide from navigation setting on all levels of the site framework. You need to update existing sites that use an extra top-level site if you do not want this to display in the site navigation.

Before Content Template version 4.1, it was recommended that an extra site area was added at the top of a site. This is no longer required, and breadcrumbs have been updated to match this change. To support existing sites, you need to apply the **Folder** authoring template to any existing top-level site areas that are not meant to be visible in your navigation.

**Note:** If you have not updated the CTC Demo site, you must apply the **Folder** authoring template to the top-level site area of the CTC Demo Library.
