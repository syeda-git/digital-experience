# Post upgrade steps

After you install the most recent version of Content Template Catalog, you will need to complete some additional steps to complete the upgrade.

-   **[Upgrade you site to Dojo 1.9](../ctc/ctc-install-upgrade-dojo.md)**  
Content Template 4.4 requires Dojo 1.9. When you upgrade to Content Template 4.4, you must also upgrade to Dojo 1.9.
-   **[How to preserve theme and layout changes after you upgrade from 3.x](../ctc/ctc_migr_custtheme-3-x.md)**  
If you are upgrading to Content Template 4.4 from version 3.x, to make an existing theme or layout work with the new Content Template layouts and themes, some changes are required.
-   **[Preserving theme and layout changes after upgrading from 4.1.x \| CTC for HCL Digital Experience](../ctc/ctc_migr_custtheme-4-1-x.md)**  
If you are upgrading to Content Template 4.4 from version 4.1.x, to make an existing theme or layout work with the new Content Template layouts and themes, some changes are required.
-   **[How to upgrade a custom theme](../ctc/ctc_migr_custom_theme.md)**  
When upgrading, only the default HCL Portal theme is upgraded. If you have previously created any custom themes, you need to make these changes to access the new features in Content Template.
-   **[Breadcrumbs and top-level site areas](../ctc/ctc_migr_homepages.md)**  
This step applies to 3.x to 4.4 and 4.0 to 4.4 upgrades only. Breadcrumbs were updated in Content Template version 4.1 to display navigation from the top-level down, and to also recognize the Hide from navigation setting on all levels of the site framework. You need to update existing sites that use an extra top-level site if you do not want this to display in the site navigation.
-   **[Upgrading to use the Setup Index Filter component](../ctc/ctc_upg_index_filter.md)**  
A new Setup Index Filter component is available that supersedes the old Index Filter component.
-   **[Enabling anonymous search](../ctc/ctc_deploy_search_template.md)**  
For websites that allow anonymous users to view the site, you need to configure search to allow anonymous users to search your site.
