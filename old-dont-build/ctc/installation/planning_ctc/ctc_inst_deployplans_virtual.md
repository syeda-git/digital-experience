# Scoped assets for virtual portals

The installation contains assets that are not scoped to a virtual portal and assets that are.

Scoping of content assets to virtual portals in HCL Digital Experience 8.5 depends on whether you use the "Managed Pages" feature.

Pages and page templates are always scoped. The CTC application and HCL Digital Experience configuration are not scoped.

If managed pages are enabled, Content Template libraries are scoped to virtual portals. If managed pages are not enabled, then Content Template libraries are not scoped to virtual portals.
