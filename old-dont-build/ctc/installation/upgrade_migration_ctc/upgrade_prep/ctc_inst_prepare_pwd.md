# \(Optional\) Supplying administrator passwords before installation \| CTC for HCL Digital Experience

You can add the WasPassword and PortalAdminPwd passwords to the wkplc.properties file. You then run the Content Template Catalog installation program without adding the passwords on the command line. Skip this step if you prefer to provide passwords when you start the installation program.

1.  Use a text editor to open the wkplc.properties file in the `[wp\_profile\_root](../reference/wpsdirstr.md)/ConfigEngine/properties` directory.

2.  Provide values for WasPassword and PortalAdminPwd.

3.  Save and close the file.
