# Upgrade preparation

Before you upgrade, you need to prepare your system to be ready to install the new version of Content Template.

**Important:** It is important that you have correctly migrated your HCL Portal and Web Content Manager servers to version 8.5 and installed CF08 or higher before upgrading your version of Content Template. Otherwise Content Template might not function properly.

-   **[Planning an upgrade to customized Content Template Catalog sites](../ctc/ctc_inst_deployplans_migr.md)**  
If you plan to upgrade Content Template and you have customized components from the previous release, you must take steps to protect and migrate your customized designs.
-   **[\(Optional\) Supplying administrator passwords before installation \| CTC for HCL Digital Experience](../ctc/ctc_inst_prepare_pwd.md)**  
You can add the WasPassword and PortalAdminPwd passwords to the wkplc.properties file. You then run the Content Template Catalog installation program without adding the passwords on the command line. Skip this step if you prefer to provide passwords when you start the installation program.
-   **[Upgraded and deprecated Content Template assets](../ctc/ctc_migr_assets.md)**  
When you install Content Template Catalog 4.4 on an existing Content Template 3 or 3.1 solution, existing assets are either upgraded or deprecated. You should test every part of your site after upgrading to make sure that there are no unexpected changes.
