# Adding languages

Languages can be added by copying the CTCBundle.properties file and renaming the copy in the format CTCBundle\_Language Code.properties. For example, a Chinese translation is stored in a file that is called CTCBundle\_zh.properties in the same location as the original file.

Common language codes include:

-   de - German
-   en - English
-   fr - French
-   es - Spanish
-   ja - Japanese
-   zh - Chinese

A more comprehensive list of language codes can be obtained by searching for Javaâ„¢ language codes in your browser.
