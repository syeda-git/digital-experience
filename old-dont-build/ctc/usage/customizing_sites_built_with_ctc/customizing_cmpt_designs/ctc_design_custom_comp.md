# Customizing component designs

Content Template Catalog components are copied into your design library, modified, and then used in page component configurations and portlets. Otherwise, updates to Content Template overwrites changes.

-   **[Customizing list components](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_comp_list.md)**  
If a new query is required, you can write a new menu, rule, or navigator.
-   **[Customizing block components](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_comp_block.md)**  
When new components are required for the page that are not lists, use the Block pattern instead.
