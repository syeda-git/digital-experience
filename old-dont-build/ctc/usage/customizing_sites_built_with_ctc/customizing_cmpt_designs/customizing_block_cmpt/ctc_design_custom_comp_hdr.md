# Customizing headers and footers for block components

You can create new headers or footers for your component configurations. These can then be selected in a Block item.

Here are some examples of customized headers and footers:

-   Headers and footers can test for the existence of content before rendering, making it possible to completely hide a component if there is no content to display.
-   Headers and footers in list components can be used to display paging information. List components render them inside the context of the list rendering or in the no results design.
