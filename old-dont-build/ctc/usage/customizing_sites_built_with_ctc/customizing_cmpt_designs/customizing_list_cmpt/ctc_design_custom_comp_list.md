# Customizing list components

If a new query is required, you can write a new menu, rule, or navigator.

Consider these best practices when customizing list components:

-   Copying a similar list component is the easiest way to create a new one.
-   Content Template Catalog lists render the header and footer components inside the list. This technique is used to render nothing if the list is empty.

-   **[Customizing headers, footers, and result designs for lists \| CTC for HCL Digital Experience](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_comp_result.md)**  
The List Presentation component combines definitions for headers, footers, and result designs in one reusable component. Copying a similar List Presentation component is the easiest way to create your own List Presentation component. Store your List Presentation component in a custom library for use in List, Slideshow, and Carousel items.
