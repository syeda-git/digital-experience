# Creating a presentation template

Presentation templates determine the structure of each web page in your site and which elements and components are displayed on each page. Presentation templates are used to change the look of a page without having to update what is being displayed on a page.

Use your own library to store the presentation template. Do not store it in the CTC Design library.

1.  Copy an existing Content Template Catalog presentation template as a starting point if another one is similar. If you copied an authoring template as a starting point, then copy the corresponding presentation template. Otherwise, create a template from scratch.

2.  Add tags to render extra fields, or remove rendering of fields that are no longer valid, as necessary.

3.  Save the new template.

4.  Go back to your authoring template, and select this presentation template as the default presentation.
