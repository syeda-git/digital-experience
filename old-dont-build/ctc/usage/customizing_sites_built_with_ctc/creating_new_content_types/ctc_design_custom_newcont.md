# Creating new content types

The content types in Content Template Catalog are general enough to be used in most scenarios. However, you can add your own content types for specific purposes, such as tying into internal workflow processes, storing additional information like product codes, or representing highly structured content types.

An authoring template is used to define the default authoring settings for site areas and content items. This includes the design of the authoring form, what fields and elements appear on the authoring form, and default values for fields and elements.
-   **[Creating a presentation template](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_newcont_pres.md)**  
Presentation templates determine the structure of each web page in your site and which elements and components are displayed on each page. Presentation templates are used to change the look of a page without having to update what is being displayed on a page.
-   **[Creating a page template](../ctc/ctc_design_custom_newcont_page.md)**  
If you need to create new components because you need to work with different data or different queries, you will probably want to create page templates for displaying the new content types along with existing content types.
