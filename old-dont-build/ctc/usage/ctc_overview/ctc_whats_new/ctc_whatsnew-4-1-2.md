# New features in Content Template 4.1.2 and 4.1.3

New features for Content Template Catalog 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 include a new "embed" mode for inline editing, and predefined groups and users.

## Inline Edit Embed Mode

The new "embed" mode for inline editing is used throughout the CTC demo site, page templates, and site templates. The embed mode gives users a true in-place experience for editing rich text.

## Groups and Users

Predefined groups and users can be installed with Content Template 4.1.2 and 4.1.3. The groups are designed to demonstrate how different user types can interact with the Content Template Catalog. Each group contains sample users. You can add your own users to the predefined groups to give real users the same access as the example users. See [Groups and users](ctc_groups_users.md) for further information.
