**CSS Style**

A site designer can use a CSS file to customize the look and feel of the portlet.

## Video usage

For support on desktop and mobile devices, videos can be encoded in the different formats that are supported by the HTML5 video element. The following table shows which video formats each browser supports.

|Browser|MP4 \(H.264/ACC\)|WebM \(VP8/Vorbis\)|Ogg \(Ogg Theora/Vorbis\)|
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
|Google Chrome|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Microsoftâ„¢ Internet Explorer 9 and higher|Yes|No|No|
|Mozilla Firefox|Yes for version 21 or higher|Yes|Yes|
|Opera|Yes for version 25 or higher|Yes|Yes|
|Safari and Mobile Safari|Yes|No|No|

!!!note
    Internet Explorer does not support the video tag for versions before Version 9. If users have later versions of Internet Explorer, you must also set up Adobe Flash Player to play videos. Add the Flash player as a file resource in Web Content Manager. Then edit the Video field component in the CTC Design library to add code similar to the following pointing to the Flash Player to use.

```
<video>
<source .../>
<!-- Add flash player here -->
<object ... >
<param NAME="movie" value="VIDEO PLAYER" />
</object>
</video>
```
