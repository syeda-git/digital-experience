# Slideshows

These slideshows can be added to your page from the Create Content Slideshows view when in Edit mode.

The Slideshow template is similar to the List template, but has extra fields for configuring the behavior of the slideshow widget. The configuration includes the type of transition, duration, automatic or manual starts, when to pause, and what controls to display. The widget that is used to render the slideshow is a Dojo widget calleddojox.widget.AutoRotator. The widget rotates through the elements in a list, adding a transition between them. Content Template Catalog has examples that show linked images, but the list can contain any type of content.

The configuration information that is entered into a Slideshow configuration item is translated into parameters for the widget by using a JavaScript method in content.js. This code also instantiates the Dojo widget.

The styling of the slideshows is complex as they have a separate "caption" container that is populated as it rotates through the slideshow. The caption is stored in a hidden `DIV` element with each slide and is then copied into the visible container through event handlers that are attached to the widget.

The following example shows a promotional slideshow, with overload captions and title controls.

This second example shows a content slideshow with number controls and formatted captions.

## Slideshow configuration

Each slideshow uses a configuration document based on the **Slideshow** authoring template in the **CTC Design** library. The following configuration parameters are used by the slideshow:

-   **Transition**

    You can select from a range of transitions including fades, slides, pans, and wipes.

-   **Rotation**

    Select the type of rotation to apply to a slideshow. This determines how often the slides in the slideshow are shown and in what order.

-   **Slide Duration**

    This determines how long each slide in the slideshow is displayed before the next image is displayed.

    The rotation of a slideshow can be stopped by using the different methods that are chosen in this parameter.
