# Events Calendar Page Template

Use this page template to display an events calendar.

This template displays a list of date-based content in a calendar format. It is used as an alternative template to the Events, Courses, and Meetings templates, that display information as lists. New events can be created in edit mode, and when the event is published it appears on the calendar. The content is created with the Event authoring template.

The calendar uses a JavaScript widget that is implemented as a Dojo dijit. When changes to events are made in the calendar, an Ajax request is sent to the Web Content Manager REST API to update the event on the server. This process ensures that the user gets a responsive experience in the browser, while also maintaining the state of the content on the server.

This page template is an example of how to create your own browser widgets that use the Web Content Manager REST API. The widgets can be created with any JavaScript API, such as JQuery or Dojo.

-   Events on calendar are populated by using searchFilter.jsp:
    -   This jsp searches for published upcoming and past events under content site area.
    -   It is deployed in WebSphere Install Root/wp\_profile/installedApps/node/ctc.ear/ctc.war/.
-   When creating your own client-side widgets backed by Web Content Manager content:
    -   The events calendar uses the JavaScript file ItemRepository.js that is part of a JavaScript API for sending requests to the Web Content Manager REST API
    -   The JavaScript API for sending requests to the Web Content Manager REST API is contained in the in place edit WAR on the server. This WAR is deployed at WebSphere Install Root/wp\_profile/installedApps/node/wcm.ear/wcm-inplaceEdit.war/.
