## Configuring the search results

The Search Results page template uses the search component **CTC Design** \> **Components** \> **List Components** \> **Search Results List**. This search component is configured to use the "Default Search Service" and "Default Search Collection" that is installed with.HCL Portal. The search results are limited to the current site. For instance, searches done in the CTC Demo site are limited to content in the CTC Demo library.

In addition, some content is filtered out, so that the search results represent real site content, such as articles, events, or offerings. You can define what content types are filtered our by opening the Search Results page in edit mode and editing the Index List content item. The List Templates field contains a list of authoring templates. Content that is created with these templates are filtered out.

By default, the excluded authoring templates are Block, Carousel, Content Feed, Landing Page, Index Page, List, Promotion, Teaser, and Slideshow.

There are 2 JSPs located at [wp\_profile\_root](../reference/wpsdirstr.md)/installedApps/CTC.ear/ctc.war/jsp that are used by the search results page template that might need to be customized:

-   **searchFilter.jsp**

    Filters the search terms that are set as request parameters and redirect to the Portal URL that shows the appropriate search results.

-   **search.jsp**

    Overrides the default search component in the theme and redirect to the CTC search page if one exists.
