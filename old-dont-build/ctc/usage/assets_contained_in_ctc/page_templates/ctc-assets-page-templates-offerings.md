# Offerings Page Template

Use this page template to display content about a product or service for sale.

The offering template is the most powerful template that is used by Content Template. It uses a content item like other templates, but also multiple images and videos that are stored in site areas in the same location as the content item. The content author adds and removes images and videos as required. These are displayed along with the content on the page. When creating pages from most page templates, a single content item is copied into the site. However, when a new offering is created, a whole micro-site is copied from the template into your site, consisting of multiple site areas and content.

This pattern can be copied to create templates for other micro-sites, or when an arbitrary number of elements of a certain type are required in a content.

-   The offering code plugs into the Web Content Manager inline item creation JavaScript code by using the plug-in point `wcmModules.inplace.create.showForm()`. This is located in `content.js`.
-   The site area branch creation can be found in `CopyBranch.jsp`.
