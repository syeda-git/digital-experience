# Dynamic Body

When a user clicks a content item link, the appropriate page is located and the portlets retrieve information from this item. To enable this behavior, a Dynamic Body portlet must be added to the page where the content item is displayed.

## Usage

This portlet is used to display the title, summary, and body of the current content item and provide inline editing. It is used on pages where you need to display a content item in full. It is placed in the body of a page.

## Adding the portlet to a page

1.  Go to the page where you want to display content.
2.  Click **Edit Mode**.
3.  Click **Create** \> **Applications** and search for dynamic.
4.  Drag the **Dynamic Body** portlet to the page and save the page.
