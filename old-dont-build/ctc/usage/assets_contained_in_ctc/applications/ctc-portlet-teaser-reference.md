# Teaser Reference

This portlet is used to display some teaser rich text on a page by referring to an existing teaser. Use this portlet to reuse a teaser in multiple places.

Teasers are similar to page component configurations. However, because they are expected to be modified often or short-lived, they are stored in a separate area to make them easier to find and manage. This area is called "Teasers" and it is created for you each time you create a new area by using a Content Template Catalog Landing or Index page template.

Details pages do not have a Teasers area under them, but you can use a Teaser Reference portlet to reference static Teaser content. Note that the Teaser Reference portlet points to a dummy content item, a prompt to edit the shared settings for the portlet. Do not modify the dummy item; it is a single dummy item in the CTC Content library, not a copy.

## Usage

This portlet can be used anywhere on your site to display some rich text.
