# Metadata and Analytics

This portlet is configured to push metadata from the current content into the page header and to also render a set of analytics tags.

## Usage

On all of the Content Template Catalog templates, this portlet is placed in the Hidden portlets area and logs the current content. If you create pages from scratch, or create your own templates, you can use this portlet to add the same metadata and analytics logging capabilities. You can create your own analytics logging blocks and use them in a similar way.

## Adding the portlet to a page

1.  Go to the page where you want to add a Metadata and Analytics portlet.
2.  Click **Edit Mode**.
3.  Click **Create** \> **Applications** and search for metadata.
4.  Drag the **Metadata and Analytics** portlet to the page and save the page.
