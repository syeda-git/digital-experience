# CTC Content library

The CTC Content library contains the microsites associated with the page templates. It also contains the content that is used in all of the pre-configured portlets, plus seed content that is used to populate new sections of a site created by using Content Template page templates.

If you use Content Template Catalog to build a site rather than as a site management tool, you can leave the content as is. However, if you use the Content Template templates as a platform for ongoing rapid site development, you should replace the sample content with content tailored to your application. You might also want to add microsites for your own specific page templates.

The content of the Content library is not translated. If you want to support multiple locales, see [How to apply the multilingual solution to Content Template sites](ctc_deploy_locale.md).
