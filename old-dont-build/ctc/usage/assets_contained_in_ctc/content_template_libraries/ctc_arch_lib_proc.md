# CTC Process library

The CTC Process library contains categories and workflows. To match your organization's profiling and change management strategies, you must modify and add categories and workflows.

Do not modify the assets in this library directly because they are overwritten if you install a newer release of the CTC Process library. To make changes, create your own process library and copy into it the components you want to modify.

All of the content of the process library is translated, so that the process content can be used in any locale.
