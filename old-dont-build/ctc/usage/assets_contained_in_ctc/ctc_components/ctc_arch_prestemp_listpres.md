# The List Presentation component

You can add the List Presentation component to any page created from the List, Slideshow, or Carousel templates. The component is used to define a header, footer, and result design in one place and reuse the component on multiple pages. Pages that are created from the Block Template do not use List Presentation components.

The CTC Demo Landing page uses a Promotions Slideshow component on the Home page that references the List Presentation component called "Large Captions Slideshow List Design for Promotions." Users click a caption in the horizontal list to see the slide that goes with it.

You can see more definitions for List Presentation components in the CTC Design library. Open Library Explorer in HCL Web Content Manager. Click **CTC Design** \> **Components** \> **List Presentation Components**. The List Presentation components that come with the CTC Design library are frequently used combinations of headers, footers, and result designs. You can also create your own List Presentation components and store them in a separate library.
