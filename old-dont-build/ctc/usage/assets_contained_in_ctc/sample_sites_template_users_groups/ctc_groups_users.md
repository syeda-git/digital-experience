# Groups and users

A set of predefined groups and users are included with Content Template. The groups are designed to demonstrate how different user types can interact with Content Template. Each group contains sample users. You can add your own users to the predefined groups to give real users the same access as the example users.

**Note:** These predefined groups and users are supported on stand-alone servers only. They might not install properly on a cluster, or when using a custom LDAP.

Each group includes a generic user and a real world persona. The generic users are useful when creating quick prototypes. The personas are useful when creating demonstration sites. The password for each user is the same as its login name.

## Installing

These groups and users are not configured to be installed by default. You must change the CTC\_USERS parameter to true in the ctc.properties file before installing or upgrading Content Template.

If you install these after an initial installation of Content Template, you must manually set permissions for each user and group.
