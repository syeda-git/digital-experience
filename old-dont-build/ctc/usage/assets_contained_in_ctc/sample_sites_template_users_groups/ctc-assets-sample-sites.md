# Sample sites, site templates, groups, and users

The sample site and site templates are built by using CTC assets and are examples of best practice development. The sample groups and users are examples of best practices for user access.

-   **[The Content Template demonstration site](../ctc/ctc_overview_comp_demo.md)**  
The demonstration site included with Content Template Catalog showcases a fully functioning website for a fictitious conference to be held in Sydney, Australia. It demonstrates best practices by using many popular Content Template components, including microsites, slideshows, social media tools, lists, and index pages.

Four localized CTC demonstration sites can be optionally installed to add multilingual content and features to the CTC Demo site.
-   **[The Content Template Internet site template](../ctc/ctc_overview_comp_demo-internet.md)**  
This template creates an internet site with Content Template theme extensions enabled. The site includes Landing pages and Index and Detail page pairs. You can add pages later with the HCL Portal site toolbar and change content on pages that allow it. You use Site Builder to install new sites by using the Internet site template.
-   **[The Content Template Intranet sample site](../ctc/ctc_overview_comp_demo-intranet.md)**  
This template creates an intranet site based on the Portal theme. The site includes Landing pages and Index and Detail page pairs. You can add pages later with the HCL Portal site toolbar and change content on pages that allow it. You use Site Builder to install new sites by using the Intranet site template.
-   **[Empty Content site template](../ctc/ctc_overview_comp_demo-empty.md)**

-   **[Groups and users](../ctc/ctc_groups_users.md)**  
A set of predefined groups and users are included with Content Template. The groups are designed to demonstrate how different user types can interact with Content Template. Each group contains sample users. You can add your own users to the predefined groups to give real users the same access as the example users.
