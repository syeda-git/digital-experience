# The Content Template demonstration site

The demonstration site included with Content Template Catalog showcases a fully functioning website for a fictitious conference to be held in Sydney, Australia. It demonstrates best practices by using many popular Content Template components, including microsites, slideshows, social media tools, lists, and index pages.

The demonstration site is an optional installation, as you might only want to install it the first time you add Content Template to a server. The CTC Demo library stores all the components for the demonstration site.

To edit items in the Content Template demonstration site, a user needs:

-   Editor access on the relevant pages
-   Editor access on the CTC Demo library
-   Contributor access on the CTC Content, CTC Design, and the CTC Process libraries

It is not recommended to use the CTC Demo for anything but a demonstration site. Each time Content Template Catalog is upgraded, the CTC Demo site is replaced with a newer version, and any changes you have made to the CTC Demo site is lost.

The site has a home page and several other microsites with one or more pages. Many of the elements are reused across the site, which is styled for the page on which they appear.
