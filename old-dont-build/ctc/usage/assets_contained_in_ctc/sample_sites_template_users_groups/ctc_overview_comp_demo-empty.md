# Empty Content site template

This template creates a site with a home page with Content Template theme extensions enabled. You can add pages later with the HCL Portal site toolbar and change content on pages that allow it.

When creating a new website by using the Content Template page templates, you must first create a new site by using a Content Template enabled site template. While the Internet and intranet sample sites are useful for generic websites, the Empty Content Site Template is perfect for other sites where you want to have more control over what pages and portlets you want to add to your site.
