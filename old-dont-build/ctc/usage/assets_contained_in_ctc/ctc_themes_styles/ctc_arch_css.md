# Content Template Catalog themes and styles

The main styles that are used in Content Template Catalog are used for themes, portlet content, and printed documents. Modify the theme and layout styles to change the layout of Content Template designs. Modify the general content styles and component styles to change the design of individual components.

-   **[Content Template stylesheets](../ctc/ctc_arch_css_files.md)**  
Content Template installs with theme-oriented styles and content-oriented styles. The two types of style files are kept separate to support responsive web design and allow targeting of scripts at specific devices.
-   **[Content Template theme extensions](../ctc/ctc_arch_theme.md)**  
Content Template Catalog sites that run on HCL Digital Experience 8.5 are based on the HCL Portal 8.5 theme with Content Template theme extensions added.
-   **[Override pattern for styles](../ctc/ctc_arch_css_override.md)**  
Content Template Catalog defines most content styles globally. It then overrides the content style for the layout containers first and then for particular component types.
-   **[Flexible page component layouts](../ctc/ctc_arch_css_flexlayout.md)**  
Adding flexibility to your layouts allows page components to adjust to fit in different parts of the layout. For example, you can use relative widths so page components adjust to the parent container, you can crop images to make them smaller, and you can use relative positioning of elements within the container.
-   **[HTML layout styles for Content Template Catalog](../ctc/ctc_arch_css_theme.md)**  
These styles cover the header and footer that are installed with the Content Template Catalog theme extensions.
-   **[Layout styles](../ctc/ctc_arch_css_layout.md)**  
These styles are used to format the layout of the page. Widths are fixed at this level. Internal styles use widths relative to the fixed widths, so when you modify these layouts, the rest of the content adjusts to fit.
-   **[General content styles](../ctc/ctc_arch_css_content.md)**  
These styles are applied to the different types of data that is rendered in Content Template Catalog sites. For example, the title of an item is always rendered with â€œitemTitle."
-   **[Page Component styles](../ctc/ctc_arch_css_component.md)**  
The page component styles are applied to the various types of page components that are used in Content Template Catalog. The styles are always applied to a container DIV. Subselectors are used to specify the internal formatting of the page component.
