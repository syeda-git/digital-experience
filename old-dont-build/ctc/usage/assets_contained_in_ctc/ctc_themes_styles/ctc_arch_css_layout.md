# Layout styles

These styles are used to format the layout of the page. Widths are fixed at this level. Internal styles use widths relative to the fixed widths, so when you modify these layouts, the rest of the content adjusts to fit.

-   `contentLeader` – full-width area used for promotional and signposting content
-   `contentMain` – main content area on the page
-   `wpthemeCol8of12 wpthemePrimary wpthemeWide split42Main` – main column in 4/2 ratio split
-   `wpthemeCol4of12 wpthemeSecondary wpthemeNarrow split42Right` – sidebar column in 4/2 ratio split
-   `wpthemeCol1of5 wpthemeSecondary wpthemeThin split121Left` – side navigation column in 1/2/1 ratio split
-   `wpthemeCol3of5 wpthemePrimary wpthemeMedium split121Main` – main column in 1/2/1 ratio split
-   `wpthemeCol1of5 wpthemeTertiary wpthemeThin split121Right` – sidebar column in 1/2/1 ratio split
-   `contentRibbon` – full-width area for promotional/navigational content
-   `contentFollower` – full width area for navigational content

The following classes are included for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of Content Template Catalog. All styles should be written to use the new wptheme classes instead.

-   `contentMain split42Main` – main column in 4/2 ratio split

-   `contentMain split121Left` – side navigation column in 1/2/1 ratio split
