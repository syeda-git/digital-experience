# Limiting the scope of a list

List portlets automatically pull content from all areas under the landing page. They cannot link content titles to a specific site area. Make the list more useful by limiting the scope of the list to a specific area and by using the title as a shortcut link to that area.

Follow these steps for lists on each landing page on your site.

1.  Switch to Edit mode.

2.  Hover over the list and click **Open Edit Form**.

3.  In the list configuration form, scroll to the "Context Override" field and select which site area to use for the list.

4.  Click **Save & Close**.

    When the page refreshes, the list focuses on a specific site area and the list title also links to that area.
