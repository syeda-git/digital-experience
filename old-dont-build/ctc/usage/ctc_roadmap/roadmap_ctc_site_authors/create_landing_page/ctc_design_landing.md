# Creating a landing page using CTC

Landing pages group areas of content together to help people find the content that they need. For example, you might create a Communications landing page that organizes all News, Executive Communications, and Press Releases in one area of your website. Anyone that is interested in seeing the most recent communications opens that landing page first.

Follow these steps to use the Landing Page template to create a landing page.

1.  Browse to your home page.

2.  Turn on Edit mode.

3.  Click **Create**.

4.  Enter the name of your page.

5.  Select the CTC Landing template.

6.  Select an insertion point.

7.  Click **Create Page**.


You now have a new page with a corresponding structure in your HCL Web Content Manager library.

-   **[Adding content to a landing page using CTC](../ctc/ctc_design_pg_land.md)**  
When you first create landing pages, they are empty. After you add the subareas you want, which will be a combination of index/details pages, and potentially further levels of landing pages, you come back and add content.
-   **[Adding a list to a landing page using CTC](../ctc/ctc_design_qs_newlists.md)**  
Now that you have content for your landing page, create a list to highlight featured content on the landing page. Do so by adding one of the Content Template Catalog predefined list portlets to the page.
-   **[Limiting the scope of a list](../ctc/ctc_design_qs_scopelists.md)**  
List portlets automatically pull content from all areas under the landing page. They cannot link content titles to a specific site area. Make the list more useful by limiting the scope of the list to a specific area and by using the title as a shortcut link to that area.
-   **[Adding a cross-linked list to a page](../ctc/ctc_design_qs_crosslinks.md)**  
As your site grows, adding cross-linked lists that link to pages at the same level or in separate areas might become necessary. For example, to list News articles on an Executive Communications page, add a list to the Executive Communications page and then configure it to retrieve content from the News area.
