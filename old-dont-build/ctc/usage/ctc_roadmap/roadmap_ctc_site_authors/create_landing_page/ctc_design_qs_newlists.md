# Adding a list to a landing page using CTC

Now that you have content for your landing page, create a list to highlight featured content on the landing page. Do so by adding one of the Content Template Catalog predefined list portlets to the page.

For some content types, the list portlet is already pre-configured and displays content immediately. For others, you must use a generic portlet and configure it to point to the content to retrieve.

1.  Browse to your landing page.

2.  Switch to Edit mode.

3.  Select the **Content** tab.

4.  Click **Lists**.

    Most lists offer two versions â€“ one is formatted for the main column and the other for the sidebar column.

5.  Drag portlets onto the page in the column you want.

6.  Switch to Edit mode.

7.  Hover over the list and click **Open Edit Form**.

8.  In the list configuration form, scroll to "List Templates" and enter the name of the template in the format:

    Library Name/Template

9.  Click **Save & Close**.


The generic portlet retrieves content beneath this landing page that was created with the specified template. The library and template name must be an exact match for this action to work.
