# Adding a cross-linked list to a page

As your site grows, adding cross-linked lists that link to pages at the same level or in separate areas might become necessary. For example, to list News articles on an Executive Communications page, add a list to the Executive Communications page and then configure it to retrieve content from the News area.

Follow these steps to create a cross-linked list and configure a context override, which is required for supplying a scope for the list.

1.  Browse to the page you want to add the list to.

2.  Switch to Edit mode.

3.  Select the **Content** tab.

4.  Click **Lists**.

5.  Drag list portlets onto the page.

6.  Click **Actions**.

7.  Switch to Edit mode.

8.  Hover over the list and click **Open Edit Form**.

9.  In the list configuration form, scroll to the **Context Override** field and select which site area to use for the list.

10. Click **Save & Close**.

    When the page refreshes, the list is now focused on a specific site area and the title of the list is also linked to that area.
