# Creating index and details pages

Most page templates create a pair of pages. They have an index page to provide content navigation and a details page to display individual content items.

The following templates are the only ones that do not require a pair of index and details pages:

-   The Stand-alone Topic template is a stand-alone Details page template for static pages.
-   The FAQ Index/Detail template combines the index and details functions in one page.
-   The Contact Us template requires only a details page.

Follow these steps to create the page or pages:

1.  Browse to the landing page you created.

2.  Turn on Edit mode.

3.  Click **Create** from the toolbar.

4.  Enter the name of your page.

5.  Select the appropriate page template for the type of content you want to create.

6.  Select where to place the new page. For example, **Child of current page**.

7.  Click **Create Page**.

    New index and details pages are created with a corresponding structure in your Web Content Manager library. After these pages are created, which might take up to a minute, you see a list of sample content items.


You now have a working pair of pages with sample content. You can edit or remove the sample content to add your own content.

-   **[Modifying index pages](../ctc/ctc_design_pg_idx.md)**  
After you create an index page from a template, add some sample content and set up an index to display it.
-   **[Modifying details pages](../ctc/ctc_design_pg_detail.md)**  
When a user clicks a content item link, the appropriate details page is located and the portlets retrieve information from this item.
