# A roadmap for Content Template Catalog site authors

This roadmap is a guide for site authors to help them get started with Content Template Catalog.

-   **[Overview for CTC site authors](../ctc/ctc_design_overview.md)**  
It is recommended that Site Builder is used to start creating a CTC site. Site Builder automates the first few steps of creating a new site. Site Builder creates a site area, a content library, and a home page automatically. Depending on the site template design, the Site Builder also creates extra pages and links them to the home page. Developing a site without Site Builder means creating a home page and landing pages manually, setting up page component configurations, then adding special content such as teasers and integrating social media.
-   **[Creating a CTC site by using Site Builder](../ctc/ctc_design_create_sb.md)**  
The recommended method of creating a site is to use a Content Template compatible Site Builder template from the Site Builder wizard. This creates a site that is Content Template ready. You then edit the site by editing any existing pages and content, adding new pages using Content Template page templates, and adding Content Template portlets as required.
-   **[Creating a landing page using CTC](../ctc/ctc_design_landing.md)**  
Landing pages group areas of content together to help people find the content that they need. For example, you might create a Communications landing page that organizes all News, Executive Communications, and Press Releases in one area of your website. Anyone that is interested in seeing the most recent communications opens that landing page first.
-   **[Creating index and details pages](../ctc/ctc_design_qs_idx.md)**  
Most page templates create a pair of pages. They have an index page to provide content navigation and a details page to display individual content items.
-   **[Creating other pages](../ctc/ctc_design_pg.md)**  
All of the Content Template Catalog page templates specify the page parameter ibm.portal.instantiation.content.dynamic.copy.target.selection as true. This means that the page template instantiation code copies the content that is associated with the page template into the site area that is mapped to the existing parent page.
-   **[How to create and edit content](../ctc/ctc_arch_inline.md)**  
The Content Template Catalog templates have three types of inline content editing built into them. The Content Template theme extensions modify the inline page editing experience too.
