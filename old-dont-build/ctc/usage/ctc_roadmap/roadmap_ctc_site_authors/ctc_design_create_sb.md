# Creating a CTC site by using Site Builder

The recommended method of creating a site is to use a Content Template compatible Site Builder template from the Site Builder wizard. This creates a site that is Content Template ready. You then edit the site by editing any existing pages and content, adding new pages using Content Template page templates, and adding Content Template portlets as required.

There are a set of Content Template compatible Site Builder templates:

-   **Empty Content site template**

    This template creates a site with a home page with Content Template theme extensions enabled.

-   **Site with Home Page Template**

    This template creates a site with a Content Template landing home page with Content Template extensions enabled. You can add pages later with the HCL Portal site toolbar and add content to the pages. The site includes a landing page that allows users to quickly start adding content while still providing the same flexibility of the Empty Content Site.

-   **Internet site template**

    This template creates an internet site with Content Template theme extensions enabled. The site includes Landing pages and Index and Detail page pairs.

-   **Intranet site template**

    This template creates an intranet site with Content Template theme extensions enabled. The site includes Landing pages and Index and Detail page pairs.


This example shows how to create a new site by using the Empty Content Site Template:

1.  Go to Site Builder and create a new site by using the Empty Content Site Template. This template creates a site with a home page with the Content Template theme extensions enabled.

2.  Go to edit mode and add child pages by using the Content Template page templates as required

3.  Add CTC portlets to the blank home page to display content and lists that would be most useful for your viewers.
