# Content Template Catalog Applications and Page Components \| CTC for HCL Digital Experience

When you install Content Template Catalog, the toolbar is enhanced with a new tab under "Applications" called "CTC Portlets", and new page components under the "Content" tab called "Teasers", "Lists", "Slideshows", "Carousels" and "Navigation". These portlets are pre-configured for use on Content Template Catalog pages. Click a portlet title to see a description of what that portlet does.

Many of these portlets are configured to create content when they are added to the page. Portlets that are named "Dynamic" or "Reference" do not create content, nor does the "Metadata and Analytics" portlet.

-   **[Content instantiation portlets](../ctc/ctc_arch_portpal_instant.md)**  
All of the teasers, lists, slideshows, carousels, and navigation portlets copy a pre-built page component configuration item into your site. The page component configurations that are referenced in these portlets are stored in the Content Page Components area of the CTC content library. The Teaser is defined in the Content Teasers area.
-   **[Strategies for using the pre-configured portlets](../ctc/ctc_arch_portpal_preconfig.md)**  
Pre-configured portlets, such as applications and page components, are used to complete the blank page templates, or to replace portlets on the other Content Template page templates.
