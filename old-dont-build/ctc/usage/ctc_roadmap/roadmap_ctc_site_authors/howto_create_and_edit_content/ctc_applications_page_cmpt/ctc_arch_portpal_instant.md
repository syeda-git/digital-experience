# Content instantiation portlets

All of the teasers, lists, slideshows, carousels, and navigation portlets copy a pre-built page component configuration item into your site. The page component configurations that are referenced in these portlets are stored in the Content Page Components area of the CTC content library. The Teaser is defined in the Content Teasers area.

When these portlets are instantiated, a copy of the page component configuration item is inserted into the **Page Components** area under the site area that is mapped to the current page.

**Note:** Because they need to be copied into a sub site area, these portlets can be used only on Landing and Index pages. They cannot be dropped onto details pages as the content cannot be created. You can, however, use a page component configuration reference portlet to display a portlet on any page.
