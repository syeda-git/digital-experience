# Content creation and editing on index pages

The index pages in Content Template Catalog are the main location for creating and managing content inline. On an index page you can create content and you can edit, open, and delete items directly from the index. If you are an authorized user, you see these controls when you point to editable parts of the page.

The title and body of all index pages are editable through in place editing. Other settings, such as contact details and index list configuration, are editable through the Open Edit Form command when you point to the index title or body.

The following example shows the in place editing for the index title when an authorized user is in edit mode.
