# A Content Template Catalog roadmap for site developers

A roadmap for site developers to help them get started with extending and customizing Content Template Catalog.

-   **[How Content Template is built](../ctc/ctc_gs_how_built.md)**  
Content Template is a model of how a website can be built by using HCL Portal and HCL Web Content Manager. You can reuse different parts of Content Template to build your own website, or use Content Template as the basis of your own model.
-   **[How a page is built by using Content Template Catalog](../ctc/ctc_gs_landing.md)**  
This is the landing page for the Internet site that is included with the Content Template Catalog and is an example of how Content Template Catalog is used to build a page.
-   **[Site structure and page templates](../ctc/ctc_arch_sitestruc.md)**  
Each site that you build with Content Template Catalog contains several page templates and a repeated structure for each site area in the content repository. You must follow this pattern when you build a Content Template site because that is how the templates were designed. Each template instantiates a "microsite" of content artifacts along with the page. The portlets on the page are automatically linked to this content.
-   **[Creating and managing page component configurations](../ctc/ctc_design_comp_config.md)**  
There are often occasions when the same page component configuration can be used either throughout the site, or at least across an entire branch of the site. In these cases, you need to manage the usage of the page component configuration by ensuring it is created once, and then reused by using the page component configuration portlet.
-   **[Content types](../ctc/ctc_arch_contypes.md)**  
Content Template Catalog Index and Details page templates are associated with several content types. These content types were selected to cover most of the common content types that are used on both intranet and internet sites.
