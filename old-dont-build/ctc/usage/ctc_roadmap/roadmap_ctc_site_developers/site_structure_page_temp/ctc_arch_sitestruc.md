# Site structure and page templates

Each site that you build with Content Template Catalog contains several page templates and a repeated structure for each site area in the content repository. You must follow this pattern when you build a Content Template site because that is how the templates were designed. Each template instantiates a "microsite" of content artifacts along with the page. The portlets on the page are automatically linked to this content.

-   **[Page templates for navigation and content](../ctc/ctc_arch_sitestruc_pgtemp.md)**  
Content Template has page templates that can be used to create landing pages, index pages, and details pages. Landing pages create the overall site structure and create a hierarchical navigation structure when they are nested. A combination of index and details pairings, stand-alone details pages, and combined index and details pages provide content areas for your site.
-   **[Microsites created from page templates](../ctc/ctc_arch_sitestruc_instant.md)**  
When a Content Template Catalog page template is instantiated, a partial site, called a microsite, is copied into your site at the same time.
