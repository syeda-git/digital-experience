# Courses content template

The Courses content template provides a simple course announcement facility, which is not meant to duplicate a course management system. The template is similar to the Job Opening template.

The Courses content template includes fields for the start and end dates for a course, its location, contact details, and an optional attachment field. It also includes a status field that indicates whether the course is still open for enrollment.
