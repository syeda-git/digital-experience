# Meetings content template

Use the Meetings content template for creating meeting announcements and for recording attendance and minutes. While calendaring systems can handle much of this type of activity, the Meetings content template is intended for meetings that need to be announced and tabled publicly.

Meetings have fields for start and end dates \(times\), location, contact details, and fields for recording attendance and minutes.
