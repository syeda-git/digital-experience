# Scheduling content

Scheduling content, such as Events and Courses, represents something that is happening in the future. This content remains on the site until that event occurs.

-   **[Events content template](../ctc/ctc_arch_contypes_event.md)**  
Use the Events content template for posting articles about upcoming events. You supply the start and end dates for the event. By default, the index page shows upcoming events and a short list of recent "featured" events. The user can browse past events by changing the date range in the filter unless you archive events. If you archive events, by using the expiry date, they are removed from the list and users cannot find them after they occur.
-   **[Courses content template](../ctc/ctc_arch_contypes_course.md)**  
The Courses content template provides a simple course announcement facility, which is not meant to duplicate a course management system. The template is similar to the Job Opening template.
-   **[Meetings content template](../ctc/ctc_arch_contypes_meet.md)**  
Use the Meetings content template for creating meeting announcements and for recording attendance and minutes. While calendaring systems can handle much of this type of activity, the Meetings content template is intended for meetings that need to be announced and tabled publicly.
