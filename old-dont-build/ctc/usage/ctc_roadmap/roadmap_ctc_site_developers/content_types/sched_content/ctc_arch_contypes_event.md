# Events content template

Use the Events content template for posting articles about upcoming events. You supply the start and end dates for the event. By default, the index page shows upcoming events and a short list of recent "featured" events. The user can browse past events by changing the date range in the filter unless you archive events. If you archive events, by using the expiry date, they are removed from the list and users cannot find them after they occur.

Events have the standard set of contact fields, and also fields for uploading an attachment and entering a link. The attachment is typically used for a brochure, while the link can be used to link off an event site, for example, in the case of larger events.

Like News, this template has the "featured" option fields, allowing an event to be included in feature lists and special feature lists.
