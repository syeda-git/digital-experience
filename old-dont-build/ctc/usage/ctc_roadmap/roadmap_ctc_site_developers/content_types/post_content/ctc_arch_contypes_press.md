# Press release content template

Use the Press release content template to post press releases on your site. It is similar to the News template, but includes extra fields for follow-up contact information and to record the original release date.

It is less likely that you would create multiple press releases areas in a site, except perhaps in a site that represents multiple organizations or companies. The press release template has both the Attribution and Contact fields. There is also a "release date" field that is optional, but can be used to display the original date the press release was made public.
