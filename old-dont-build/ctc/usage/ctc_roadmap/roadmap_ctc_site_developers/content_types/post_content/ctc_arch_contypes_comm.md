# Communication content template

The Communication content template is used for internal communications, such as executive communications and postings from a particular organizational unit. You can add a shared communications area that is used by a number of executives or units, or more typically, you can create a communications area for each.

The communication template has an extra image field for placing an image in the header of the content. Such an image might be an authorâ€™s photograph, giving the presentation an "editorial"? feel, or it might be a topical image. The communication template includes Contact fields to allow contact information to be added for the author or for someone else.
