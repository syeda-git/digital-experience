# Alerts content template

Alerts are typically used on intranets. Use them to post important information that you want readers to take note of and potentially act on.

Alerts data is similar to news and has the same contact fields as a press release. However, the use case and lifecycle are different. Alerts are maintained on the site only when they are actively important. They are expired or deleted when they are no longer valid. They are not archived for the long term, so the alert index does not include a date filter.
