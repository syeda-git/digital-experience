## Deconstructing the landing page

The landing page is made from a set of page components, including:

-   A slideshow displaying a list of promotions.
-   A list of features.
-   A block page component displaying "teaser" text.
-   A second list of features.
-   A list of child pages.

## Deconstructing the slideshow

Each page component is constructed from a set of Web Content Manager components, content items, CSS, and related files. This slideshow is an example of a single page component:

Each page component is linked to a Web Content Manager content item that stores configuration parameters for the page component. The slideshow itself includes references to:

-   A list component that defines the items that are displayed in the slideshow.
-   A list presentation that defines the layout of the slideshow.

## Deconstructing the list presentation

The list presentation itself is built by using separate designs for a header, result, and footer. These designs are themselves constructed from multiple Web Content Manager components.
