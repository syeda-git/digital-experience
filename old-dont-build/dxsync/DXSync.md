# HCL Digital Experience File Sync

Digital Experience File Sync can be used to synchronize any WebDAV-based HCL Portal theme with your local workstation. Learn more how to use DX File Sync.

As a development option, HCL Digital Experience File Sync pulls the theme files to your work station and uploads any changes you make. It runs on Windows, OSX, and Linux. Digital Experience File Sync is unsupported and can be used on HCL Digital Experience version 8.5 or higher.
