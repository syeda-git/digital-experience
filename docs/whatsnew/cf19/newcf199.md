## Design Studio (Beta)

Design Studio enables content managers and designers to build and style their digital site properties quickly. Available for use with DX 9.5 container-based deployments, Design Studio presents a modern, intuitive, and role-based tool aggregating all needed functions to visually assemble, curate, design, and model pages, content, and applications in DX sites. New features available with the Container Update CF199 release include the ability to select Web Content Manager library assets when creating sites, UI globalization, support for alternate and no context root when defining sites, and more.

!!!note
    Design Studio is provided for beta evaluation with HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Container Update CF196, and includes a sample DX site.  It is not yet supported for use in production deployments.

See the [Design Studio (Beta)](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/digital-experience/cf204/productfeatures/design_studio/) topic for more information. 

## Migrate from HCL DX 9.5 Operator to Helm Deployments

Beginning with HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Container Update CF196, administrators can deploy HCL DX 9.5 CF196 and later images to supported container platforms using Helm. Using a Helm Chart deployment can provide administrators more transparency and control in deployment operations. Beginning with Container Update CF199, support for migration from Operator-based (dxctl) to Helm-based deployments is provided.

See the [HCL DX 9.5 Helm deployment](../../deployment/install/container/operator-migration/operator_migration_preparation.md) topic for more information.

## Digital Asset Management Staging

New Digital Asset Management (DAM) staging support enables administrators to stage and synchronize DAM assets from an authoring environment (source environment/publisher) to multiple rendering environments (target environment/subscriber), using DXClient.

See the [DAM staging](../../manage_content/digital_assets/configuration/staging_dam/dam_subscription_staging.md) topic for more information.

## New HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Release Artifacts supporting CICD release processes

The HCL Digital Experience 9.5 DXClient and DXConnect servlet provides developers and administrators an approach to deploy changes or improvements to the HCL Digital Experience platform, and to automate processes in the development and delivery process. Updates include process definitions to automate Export and Import of select IBM WebSphere Application Server Resource Provider settings during deployment, and to create Syndication relationships and credential vault settings.

See the [DXClient and DXConnect tooling supporting CICD release processes](../../extend_dx/development_tools/dxclient/index.md) topic for more information.
