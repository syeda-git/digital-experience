# What's new in CF194

This HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Container Update release includes new releases of Digital Experience 9.5 core Portal and Web Content Manager, Content Composer, Digital Asset Management, and Experience API images. No new features were added in this update.

Important note: The default IBM WebSphere Application Server certificate that ships with HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Docker images expires on April 26, 2021. Access to HCL Digital Experience 9.5 container deployments is not adversely affected. However, scripts executed against the DX 9.5 deployed servers, like `stopServer` or some ConfigEngine tasks, will fail.

To address this, HCL Digital Experience 9.5 customers deploying to container platforms can use either of the following options to update the certificate:

-   Apply the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Container Update CF194, available from the [HCL Software Licensing Portal](https://www.hcltech.com/software/support/release){:target="_blank"} on April 19, 2021.
-   Renew the certificate on your DX 9.5 Container Deployment by following the steps outlined in the following HCL DX Support Knowledge Base article: [Manual Steps to Apply the Digital Experience 9.5 Container Deployment Core Certificate Update](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0089699){:target="_blank"}.
