# Content resources

Web content resources consist of data that is formatted and displayed on Web pages. Examples include articles, statistics and educational materials.

The content is displayed when a user requests a JSP or servlet that dynamically generates and formats a Web page in the appropriate format, such as HTML or XML. When personalizing your Web site, you only have to customize the content you want to selectively display (or suppress) based on the user. For example, a given page might consist of 40% static content and 60% variable content based on particular user characteristics or business conditions, while other pages might be 100% static content.

Content resources can be file content or structured content.
