# Create a visibility rule that uses referral attributes

Learn how to create the Referrer application object by using a visibility rule for your HCL Digital Experience portal website.

In this example, you are creating a visibility rule that uses the referral host and search attributes. These attributes are only used in rules to display ski related vacation information for users that search on ski trips in Google.

This rule prevents other types of information, such as beach or mountain vacation information, from displaying when users search on ski trips.

2.  From the Personalization Navigator, click **New** \> **Rule**.

4.  The numbered screen capture, along with the corresponding table, provides the values and selections that are used in this example. Use these example values and selections to guide you in creating a visibility rule that uses the referral host and search attributes.
