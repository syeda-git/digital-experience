# Referrer application object

The Referrer application object displays content based on what site or what key words from which search engine the user was referred from.

You can target your content to users based on what site the user came from before the user accessed your site. You can also target your content by the search parameters that are entered by users in a search engine.

The Referrer application object supports the following search engines:

-   Google
-   Yahoo
-   AOL
-   Ask
-   Bing
