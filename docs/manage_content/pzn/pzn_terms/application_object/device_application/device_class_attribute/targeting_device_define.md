# Defining your device classes

When you target content to a segment based on device classes, ensure that the device classes are installed and enabled in portal.

By default, the smartphone and tablet device classes are already defined for you. You can use these device classes in rules that you create. If your mobile device is not recognized by using the default smartphone or tablet device classes, you can add your device as a client to these default classes. To add your device go to **Add new client**. Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal Settings** \> **Supported Clients**. Then, click **Add new client**. You can also create an XML script to add your device.

When you add your device to the default classes, your device inherits and uses the responsive web design theme when it displays content. You can import the XML file. Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal Settings** \> **Import XML**. You can also run the XML access directly to import the XML file.

You can also create custom device classes rather than using the default classes. Clients that are assigned to custom classes use the desktop theme. For custom classes to have a responsive theme based on the type of device, you must develop custom themes for your class. For more information, see the *Responsive Web Design* section.

To add a client to a device class, you need, at a minimum, the following information about your device:

-   User-agent pattern
-   Manufacturer
-   Model
-   Client capability

Use the table to learn more about the options available to you for defining device classes.
