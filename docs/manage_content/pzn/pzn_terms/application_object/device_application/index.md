# Device application object

The Device application object displays content by device class or by location \(city, country, latitude, and longitude\).

-   **[Device class attribute](../device_application/device_class_attribute/index.md)**  
Site content can display differently for a smartphone, desktop, or other device by using the Device application object in rules.
-   **[Location attributes](../device_application/location_attribute/index.md)**  
You can use location attributes to tailor the content that displays.
