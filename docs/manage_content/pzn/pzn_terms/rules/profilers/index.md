# Profilers

Profilers are typically used to categorize an individual \(usually the current site visitor\) according to his or her user properties.

Besides a user's properties, profilers can be used to define other conditions based on such factors such as the current date and time, the type of browser the visitor uses, or other implicit and explicit application object properties. Profilers can also make decisions based on the current user's session attributes and request attributes and parameters, along with category and action counts.

Profilers can be constructed to define the conditions of arbitrarily named profiles, or can be defined in terms of other profilers. For example, you can create a profiler that will evaluate as true if a profile is in any, all, or none of a group of other profiles.
