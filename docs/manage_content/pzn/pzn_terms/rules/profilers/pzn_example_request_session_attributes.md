# Example: Request attributes and session attributes

Learn how to construct a profiler in HCL Digital Experience using request attributes and session attributes.

Request values passed to the JSP or stored in the HTTP session can be referred to from rules. To refer to them in a rule, you must know the variables and their possible values.

The following example profiles news articles as read or unread by the current user, based on the page request generated by a form on a JSP.

## Request attributes and session attributes

```
User News is
  	     ReadNews when
  	         current Request.ProcessNews is Read
  	     UnreadNews when
  	         current Request.ProcessNews is Unread
  	     UnreadAllNews when
  	         current Request.ProcessNews is UnreadAll 
```
