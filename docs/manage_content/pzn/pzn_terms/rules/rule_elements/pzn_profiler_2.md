# Profiler rule element

Profiler is a choice within the binding rule structure, and within the Specify a Resource Attribute window when constructing a profiler.

Selecting **Profiler** within a profile allows you to identify other profilers \(in effect, nesting profilers within one another\) in order to create a profiler that can evaluate as true when multiple profilers or other evaluations are true. Within a binding, you identify specific actions to perform that are based on the one profile within a profiler that evaluates as true.

You may also select quick profiler and specify a simple evaluation in-line instead of using a separate profiler.
