# Current Action Count or Name rule

Current Action Count and Current Action Name allows you to base a profiler or rule on Web visitor actions.

**Current action count**, like **current category count**, is a way to base a profiler or rule on the number of times a Web site visitor has performed certain actions. These actions must be logged using the action logging beans in order to be accessible by the rule.

**Current action name** inspects the names of the actions logged.
