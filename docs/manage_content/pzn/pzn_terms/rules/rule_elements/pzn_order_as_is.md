# order as is rule element

ORDER AS IS is used to specify the order you want selected content to be returned and used. The default, order as is, will return data in the order it is stored in the repository.

By clicking the order as is link, you can also choose **order randomly** or **order by**. Order by allows you to sort content by any of its attributes, sort by more than one attribute \(and specify the order the attributes are used to sort\), and specify whether you want each attribute in ascending or descending order. Order randomly returns data in a different order each time the rule executes.
