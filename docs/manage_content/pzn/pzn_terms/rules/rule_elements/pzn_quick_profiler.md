# Quick Profiler rule

Quick profilers are created within bindings to perform simple evaluations. By using a quick profiler, you can avoid creating simple profilers as separate rules.

When you select the profile link within a binding and choose the quick profiler option, the structure for the line will change to an evaluation. The subsequent line of the binding will be the action to perform if the quick profiler evaluates as true.
