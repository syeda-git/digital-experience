When you create a resource collection, you must assign it a unique name. That name must be unique among all of the resource collections in the current workspace. Renaming a resource collection that has rules that are created against it prevents the Personalization engine from correctly running those rules.

1.  From the Personalization Navigator, click **New Resource collection**.

2.  Type a unique collection name.

3.  Select the folder where the content spot is located.

4.  Select the resource collection type that you want to use:

    -   For an IBM Content Manager resource collection, select a node type.
    -   For a standard resource collection, provide the resource class name, manager class name, domain class name, and translator class name.
5.  Select whether the new resource collection contains user resources or content resources.
