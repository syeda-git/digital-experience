Rules define how content spots respond based on the site visitor.

1.  From the Personalization Navigator, click **New** \> **Rule**.

2.  Provide a name, location, and description for the rule.

3.  Select the type of rule.

4.  To edit rule elements, click the element name.


You can preview rules with the **Preview** tab. When you preview a rule, you are previewing as yourself. If you are not included in the target audience for the rule, then the rule fails to find a user resource for you. Depending on the resource and the rule, it might result in no results or an error.

Each rule has metadata that you can view and edit. Select the **Document Info** tab. The title, document type, description, last modified date, and date that is created is displayed.
