# Versions



If versions are active, you can save your object under a unique version number, which provides a linear history of your object's changes. Use versions also to retrieve an earlier version of an object. In addition to saving your object as a new version, you can promote a previous object version to the current version.

You can save an object with a new version number. Later you can restore that version if needed.
