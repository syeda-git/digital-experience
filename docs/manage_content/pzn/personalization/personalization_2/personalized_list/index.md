# Personalized list



The **Personalized List** portlet allows a user to display personalized content without having to build a custom JSP portlet.

Each portlet can display a list of resources and show details for each returned resource. Groups of related resources might be categorized for easy viewing. When a more detailed view of a piece of content is required, a custom detail JSP might be specified. Different instances of the portlet might be used across the portal to quickly and easily deploy customized information to users.

If a user is granted access, the type and formatting of personalized content can be changed by selecting **Back** to return to View mode. Then, selecting **Configure** from the menu on the portlet title bar. Otherwise, the administrator sets configuration.

Configuration mode allows an administrator to choose the type and formatting of the personalized content.
