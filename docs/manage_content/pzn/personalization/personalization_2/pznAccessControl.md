title: Access control for personalization objects
---




If you work with Personalization, you have a role that is assigned to you. This role defines the tasks that you can do. You might be able to personalize folders and files, or you might have read-only access. You might also have the highest level of control, the administrative role that gives you permission to determine who has access to certain objects.

If you have administrative control, you can set access control for an individual object, or you can set access control for a folder. If you set access control for a folder, all of the folder's contents have the same access settings.

## User roles

User roles that apply to personalization include user, editor, manager, and administrator.

The following user roles do not apply to personalization: privileged user, delegator, and security administrator.

-   **User**

    The User has read-only access to Personalization objects. Users can see the resource, but cannot modify or contribute content of their own.

-   **Editor**

    The Editor can view and add folders or documents to the current resource. Editors can also modify the properties and content of existing documents and files. Editors cannot move files.

-   **Manager**

    The Manager has all the privileges of Editors. The Manager can also modify the properties and content of all objects, delete folders and objects underneath the current resource, override document locks, and move objects.

-   **Administrator**

    The Administrator can do everything that the user, editor, or manager role can do. The Administrator can also assign access to Personalization objects.


## Examples

Here are some example role assignments:

-   Someone who is not on your project can have a User role.
-   Editors and writers can have an Editor role.
-   Team leads and managers can have a Manager role.
-   A project manager or manager can have an Administrator role.
