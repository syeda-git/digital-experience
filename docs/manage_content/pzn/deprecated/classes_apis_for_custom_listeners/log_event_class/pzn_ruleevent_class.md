# RuleEvent class

A RuleEvent class is constructed whenever a rule is executed. It contains information about the rule that was executed and the resulting resources. It is an implicitly constructed event; a logging bean is not necessary.

```
public class com.ibm.wcp.analysis.event.RuleEvent extends com.ibm.wcp.analysis.event.LogEvent
                                                  implements Serializable

```
