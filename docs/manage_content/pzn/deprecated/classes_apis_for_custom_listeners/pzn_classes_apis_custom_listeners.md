# Classes and APIs for writing custom listeners

In order to write custom listeners, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the classes representing logging events and info that is contained in those events. A reference of these classes is provided here.

-   **[LogEvent class](../classes_apis_for_custom_listeners/log_event_class/pzn_logevent_class.md)**  
The LogEvent class is the base class for all run-time logging events. The methods in this class are used to access all basic HTTP request information.
-   **[ResourceInfo class](pzn_resourceinfo_class.md)**  
The ResourceInfo class is a wrapper class for a resource id and collection name tuple.
-   **[RuleInfo class](pzn_ruleinfo_class.md)**  
The RuleInfo class is a wrapper class for a rule name and campaign name tuple.
