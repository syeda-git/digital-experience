# Repeated items in visit list

To specify whether the buildvisit utility should repeat an item in the visit list to be shown to a user, set db.visitlist.ratability.duplication\_threshold. Items with ratability values greater than this threshold may be repeated.

For example:

```
db.visitlist.ratability.duplication_threshold = 6
```
