# Feedback and analytics

Personalization provides a complete logging framework for collecting data on how visitors are using your Web site. If Feedback is enabled, data is automatically collected about each Personalization rule that is fired. In addition, development tools enable Web sites to collect a variety of data related to visitors' actions and behavior. By default this data is logged to a standard database schema for later analysis and reporting. The framework is also extensible, allowing Web sites to customize and supplement the way data is collected and stored to more fully meet their needs.

Using the Personalization Feedback framework you can collect data to help answer questions such as:

-   How effective are the new campaign initiatives?
-   Which items have the highest clickthrough ratio?
-   What is the clickthrough ratio for health care products?
-   Which items have the highest view to purchase ratio?
-   What is the ratio for health care products?
-   Which rules are resulting in the most number of downloads?
-   During the month of December, which categories of pages were browsed most often (my special Christmas pages, or the regular part of my site)?
