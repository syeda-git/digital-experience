# CustomLog beans

CustomLog beans give you the flexibility to log data that does not easily map to the other logging beans. You use CustomLog beans to log application specific data. You define the required key name\(s\) as well as the value\(s\) for that key.

Logged data is stored in the Feedback schema in the HITPARMS, KEY\_VALUE\_COMBO, KEY\_VALUE\_PAIR, KEY, and VALUE tables. If you use CustomLog beans, you may want to create custom report elements.

All custom log data is logged to the Feedback schema. Custom log data is not logged to the LikeMinds schema nor to the user session.
