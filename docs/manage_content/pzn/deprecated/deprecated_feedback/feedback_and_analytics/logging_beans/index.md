# Logging beans

Use logging beans to log data about a Web site visitor's actions, category interests, and ratings.

You can also use custom beans to log information specific to your Web application. You insert logging beans into your JSPs. The types of logging beans are:

-   Action beans
-   Rating beans
-   Category beans
-   CustomLog beans
-   Page View beans

-   **[Action beans](../logging_beans/actionbeans/pzn_action_beans.md)**  
You use Action beans to log specific actions of your Web site visitors.
-   **[Category beans](../logging_beans/categorybeans/pzn_category_beans.md)**  
Content categories enable you to classify Web user interests. You use Category beans to log content categories.
-   **[Rating beans](../logging_beans/ratingbeans/pzn_rating_beans.md)**  
The Rating bean is a specialized logging bean. You use Rating beans in applications that solicit user ratings for web content or other personalization resources.
-   **[CustomLog beans](../logging_beans/customlog_beans/pzn_customlog_beans.md)**  
CustomLog beans give you the flexibility to log data that does not easily map to the other logging beans. You use CustomLog beans to log application specific data. You define the required key name\(s\) as well as the value\(s\) for that key.
-   **[PageView beans](../logging_beans/pageview_beans/pzn_pageview_beans.md)**  
You use PageView beans to log HTTP request data for JSPs \(JavaServer pages\).
