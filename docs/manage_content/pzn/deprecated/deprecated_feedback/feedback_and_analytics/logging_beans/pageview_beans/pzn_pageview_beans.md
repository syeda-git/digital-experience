# PageView beans

You use PageView beans to log HTTP request data for JSPs \(JavaServer pages\).

The HTTP request data logged by PageView beans provides basic Web usage data that can be used during Web traffic analysis. The Action, Category, CustomLog, and Rating beans automatically collect the same basic HTTP data that is collected by the PageView bean. HTTP request data is also collected whenever a rule is executed. Use the PageView bean if the JSP of interest has no other logging beans or content spots, and you want to include the JSP in usage analysis.
