# Feedback subsystem overview

The Feedback listener captures data and writes it to the Feedback database schema for subsequent reporting, a capability which can be used to persist data in ways that specifically meet your requirements.

Logging occurs when a rule or logging bean is present in JSP or servlet a user visits. In either case, during execution an event containing data to be logged is generated and dispatched by the log manager to a set of listeners.Personalization supplies two such listeners. The first is the Feedback listener, which captures data and writes it to the Feedback database schema for subsequent reporting. The second is the LikeMinds listener \(LMListener\), which captures data for subsequent use by the LikeMinds recommendation engine. Web site developers can optionally extend the provided listeners or create additional custom listeners to persist data in ways that specifically meet their needs.

-   Logging events are generated by Personalization rules or logging beans.
-   The Feedback subsystem's multi-threaded implementation prevents HTTP clients from waiting.
-   The Log Manager maintains internal queue of events.
-   Event is dropped on queue then control returned to web client.
-   Events are dispatched from the queue to all registered listeners.
-   Listeners in turn persist and process the data contained in the logging event.
