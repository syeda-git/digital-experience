# Using DAM extensibility

This section describes the DAM extensibility feature and how to configure your setup for extensibility.

DAM extensibility allows DAM to support user-defined custom renditions and transformations for images. This feature can be used to integrate with third-party plug-ins for custom asset processing, for example, to resize, crop, rotate, or other custom operations, and many more, while supporting default and custom renditions. In addition to this, keyword generation and video management have also been enabled for extensibility.

!!! note 
    If there are changes done in these json files (rendition-extensibility.json, plugin-extensibility.json, kaltura-plugin.json) in the previous versions, they need to be manually modified in the values.yaml
