# Access HCL Digital Asset Management

This section provides the steps on how to access HCL Digital Asset Management \(DAM\) and use it as a central platform to store and include rich media assets. Using the HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Digital Asset Management features, users can upload, browse, and search for media files, edit images and metadata, and manage collections and media access.

## Prerequisite

HCL DAM should be installed and configured in your HCL Digital Experience 9.5 deployment.

- For Helm-based deployments, see the [Deploying DX 9.5 applications to container platforms using Helm](../../../get_started/plan_deployment/container_deployment/application_architecture.md) topic for instructions on deploying applications

!!! note
    If you are using a content delivery network \(CDN\) such as [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/our-thinking/cdn/what-is-a-cdn), using `Vary: Origin` may prevent you from caching content. To bypass this limitation, your CDN configuration must strip the `Vary` header on the way in, to reinstate your ability to cache content. On the way out, you can append the `Origin` parameter to the `Vary` header when serving a response using **'Modify Outgoing Response Header'**.

## Access HCL Digital Asset Management from WCM Authoring Portlet or Inline Editing

Content authors can access and use DAM media items when creating or editing content, components, or content templates in the Web Content Manager authoring portlet or inline editing. Both the image and the file components and elements can be configured to use DAM as the source.

To enable users to use DAM as the source while editing the content, use one of the following options:

- Remove the existing image or file from the content and then select a new image from DAM.
- In the **Image field properties** window, select the **Show digital asset source** check box, and then select HCL DAM in the **Digital asset source** drop-down list.
