# Web Content Library

Web Content Libraries help you organize Web Content. Use this section to learn how to create and manage them.

- **[Create a content library](oob_content_createlib.md)**
 You use the Administration portlets to create libraries. You can have multiple content libraries. To determine how many libraries you need, consider the type of site you are developing and who needs access to certain content. A minimum of two libraries is common, one for items required for the web content system and another library for content.
- **[Set up access to libraries](oob_content_accesslib.md)**
You have a number of ways to grant and restrict access to libraries. There are five content user roles: User, Contributor, Editor, Manager, and Administrator. Each role has specific access rights. You can associate individual users or groups of users with a role. There are three levels that you can assign access to: library, item type per library, and item level.
- **[Defining roles within a library](wcm_configure_library_role.md)**  
You can define the access of a user or group for a library to determine who has access to a library, and to define access within the authoring portlet.
- **[Copying / Moving Items Between Libraries](wcm_dev_items_copying.md)**
You can copy and move items between libraries
- **[Unlocking a library](wcm_admin_library_unlock.md)**  
A library can become locked when a long running task, such as restoring all content items in a library, fails to unlock the library.
- **[Deleting a web content library](wcm_config_wcmlibrary_delete.md)**  
When a web content library is no longer required, you can delete the library.
- **[Disabling a web content library](wcm_config_wcmlibrary_disable.md)**  
When a web content library is no longer required, you can disable the library.
- **[Setting root access for all web content libraries](wcm_config_library_root_access.md)**  
Learn how to set root access for all HCL Digital Experience web content libraries using the web content authoring portlet.
