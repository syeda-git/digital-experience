# Disabling a web content library

When a web content library is no longer required, you can disable the library.

You must be an administrator to disable web content libraries.

This action prevents the library from being accessed from an authoring portlet, preventing users from updating any items that are stored in the library. Any items that are referenced from this library are still rendered in web content.

1.  Go to **Administration** \> **HCL Portal** \> **Portal Content** \> **Web Content Libraries**.

2.  Click ![Edit library](../../../../images/edit.jpg) on the library you would like to edit.

3.  Clear the "Enabled" check box. This option disables the web content library.

4.  Click **OK**.
