# Personalizing federated documents

Portal Personalization provides the federated documents feature to retrieve metadata about documents that are stored in external content management systems or document repositories. Examples of these systems include HCL Content Manager, IBM FileNet Content Manager, and Microsoft Sharepoint. You can use a personalization component in HCL Web Content Manager to display metadata from federated documents and to create links to download or open the documents.

The federated documents feature can acquire metadata from remote systems that support the following methods:

-   Document Services remote interfaces, as supported by HCL Content Manager and FileNet® Content Manager
-   Content Management Interoperability Services 1.0 \(CMIS 1.0\), as supported by HCL Connections, HCL Content Manager, IBM® FileNet Content Manager, Microsoft™ Sharepoint, and others.
-   Atom feeds

Create a selection rule that selects metadata of documents that are contained in a specific folder of a remote content management system or document repository.
-   **[How to use a federated documents rule in a personalization component \| HCL Web Content Manager](../feddocs/howtouse_feddocs/index.md)**  
To access the information from a federated documents rule in your web content system, create a personalization component, associate it with the rule, and specify the design for displaying document information that is retrieved by the rule.
