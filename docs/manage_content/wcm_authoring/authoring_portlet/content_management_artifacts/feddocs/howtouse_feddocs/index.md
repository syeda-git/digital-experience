# How to use a federated documents rule in a personalization component \| HCL Web Content Manager

To access the information from a federated documents rule in your web content system, create a personalization component, associate it with the rule, and specify the design for displaying document information that is retrieved by the rule.

1.  Open the authoring portlet, and click **New** \> **Component** \> **Personalization**.

2.  Enter a name and description for the new component.

3.  Click **Search** in the **Personalization Element** section, and select the federated documents selection rule.

4.  Define the design for the headers, footers, and individual documents that are selected by the configured selection rule. Use the **AttributeResource** element to reference individual metadata fields from the selected documents.

5.  Save the component.


You can now preview your component and reference it from within presentation templates, other element designs, or a web content viewer.
