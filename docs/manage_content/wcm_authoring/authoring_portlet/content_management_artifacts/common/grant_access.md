# Granting users or groups access to an item


Specify the access control settings for the current item to designate which users have access to an item and their level of access. The access section is common to all item forms.

Users and groups can be assigned the roles of user, contributor, draft creator, editor, manager, or reviewer.

To grant users or groups access to an item:

1.  Go to the **Access** section of a form.

2.  To allow the item to inherit access roles from a parent item or library, select the check box in the **Inheritance** column of each role.

3.  To select specific users or groups instead of using inheritance, click **Grant Access** for each role.

    1.  Enter at least two characters in the **Search** field and then click **Search**.

    2.  Select the required users or groups and then click **Add**.

    3.  Click **OK**.

4.  To grant access to virtual users, use the menu next to each **Grant Access** to select either:

    -   Anonymous portal user
    -   All authenticated portal users
    -   All users
    -   Authors
    -   Owners
    -   Creator
