# Specifying the location of a content item


When you first create a content item, you are required to specify the location of the item if the location is not defined in the authoring template.

1.  Click **Select Location** and select a location to store the content item. A location can either be a page or site area.

    1.  If the selected authoring template is configured to use a single location, or if the user has access only to a single location, the content item is automatically saved.

    2.  If the selected authoring template restricts the locations that a user can select, a table of available locations is displayed. Select the locations that you would like to save the content item under. You then select how to add the content item within the location if the parent item already has children:

        -   Select **First child** to save the content item as the first listed item within a location. Then, click **OK**.
        -   Select **Last child** to save the content item as the last listed item within a location. Then, click **OK**.

    3.  If the selected authoring template does not restrict which locations can be selected, but allows multiple locations to be selected:

        -   Select **First child** to save the content item as the first listed item within a location. Then, click **OK**.
        -   Select **Last child** to save the content item as the last listed item within a location. Then, click **OK**.
        -   Select **Manage multiple selections** to select multiple locations. To choose a location to save the content item under, select a location and then click **Move to top**. The content item is saved under the first location in the list and then linked to the other locations.
        
    4.  If the selected authoring template allows only a single location to be selected, you must select a location for the content item. You then select how to add the content item within the location if the parent item already has children:

        -   Select **First child** to save the content item as the first listed item within a location. Then, click **OK**.
        -   Select **Last child** to save the content item as the last listed item within a location. Then, click **OK**.
        -   Select **Before specified child** to save the content item before a selected child item. A further selection dialog opens if this option is selected. Select a child item and then click **OK**.
        -   Select **After specified child** to save the content item after a selected child item. A further selection dialog opens if this option is selected. Select a child item and then click **OK**.
