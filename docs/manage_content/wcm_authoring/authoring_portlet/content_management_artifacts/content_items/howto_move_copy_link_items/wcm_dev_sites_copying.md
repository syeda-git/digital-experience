# Copying a site area


As your site framework evolves, you are required to edit your site framework by copying site areas from one section of your site framework to another. You use the **copy** feature to copy a site area in the site framework.

1.  Browse to a site area list.

2.  Select a site area.

3.  Click **Copy**.

4.  Select a library.

5.  Select a site area.

    1.  Items that you do not have sufficient access to select are disabled. If these items have children, you can still browse to select them.

    2.  If the selected site area has existing children, you then select how to add the new site area:

        -   Select **First child** to copy the site area as the first listed site area. Then, click **OK**.
        -   Select **Last child** to copy the site area as the last listed site area. Then, click **OK**.
        -   Select **Before specified child** to copy the site area before a selected child item. A further selection dialog opens if this option is selected. Select a child item and then click **OK**.
        -   Select **After specified child** to copy the site area after a selected child item. A further selection dialog opens if this option is selected. Select a child item and then click **OK**.

!!! note
    The children of an item are not copied when an item is copied. You must copy any children separately.
