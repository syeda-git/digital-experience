# How to remove content item links from site areas

You remove content items from site areas with the **Remove Links** or **Link** featured. This procedure is different from deleting content items because the content you choose to remove is removed from a site area, but not from the web content library.

## Removing links with the **Remove links** feature

1.  Select a site area.
2.  Click **Remove links**.
3.  Select the content items that you would like to remove.
4.  Click **OK**.

## Removing links with the **Link To** feature

1.  Select the content items to remove links from.
2.  Click **Link To**.
3.  Select the site area that you would like to remove a link from and then click **Remove**.
4.  Click **OK**.
