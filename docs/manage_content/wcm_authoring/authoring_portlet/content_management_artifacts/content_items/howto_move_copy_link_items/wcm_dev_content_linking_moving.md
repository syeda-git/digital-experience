# Moving a content item


You move content items from one site area to another using the **Move To** feature. This is different from linking content as the content you choose to move is removed from the original site area.

## Template mappings

When you choose a site area to link a content item to, ensure that the site area you choose has a valid template mapping between the authoring template and presentation template you would like to use with the selected content item.

1.  Browse to a content list.

2.  Select a content item.

3.  Click **Move**.

4.  Select a library.

5.  Select a site area to move the content item under:

    1.  Items that you do not have sufficient access to select are disabled. If these items have children you can select, you can browse to select them.

    2.  If a selected site area has existing children, you then select how to add the content item within the site area:

        -   Select **First child** to move the content item as the first listed content item within a site area. Then, click **OK**.
        -   Select **Last child** to move the content item as the last listed content item within a site area. Then, click **OK**.
        -   Select **Before specified child** to move the content item before a selected child item. A further selection dialog opens if this option is selected. Select a child item and then click **OK**.
        -   Select **After specified child** to move the content item after a selected child item. A further selection dialog opens if this option is selected. Select a child item and then click **OK**.
