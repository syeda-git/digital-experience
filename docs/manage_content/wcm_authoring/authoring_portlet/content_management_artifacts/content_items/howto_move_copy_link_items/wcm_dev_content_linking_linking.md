# How to link or copy content items to site areas

When a content item is first created, you must select a site area to save the content item under. You can link content items to other site area with the **Link** and **Add Links** buttons. You can also copy a content item to a different site area with the **Copy** button.

When you link a content item to other site areas, changes made to the content item appear everywhere the content item is linked to. If you copy a content item, a new content item is created and the link between the original content item and new content item is broken.

## Template maps

When you select a site area to link a content item to, ensure that the site area you choose has a valid template mapping between the authoring template and presentation template you would like to use with the selected content item.

## Linking

1.  Select the content items to link to other site areas.
2.  Click **Link**.
3.  Click **Add**.
4.  Select the site area that you would like to add them to.
    1.  Items that you do not have sufficient access to select are disabled. If these items have children you can select, you can browse to select them.
    2.  If the selected site area has existing children, you then select how to add the content item within the site area:
        1.  Select **First child** to link the content item as the first listed content item within a site area. Then, click **OK**.
        2.  Select **Last child** to link the content item as the last listed content item within a site area. Then, click **OK**.
        3.  Select **Before specified child** to link the content item before the selected child item. A further selection dialog opens if this option is selected. Select a child item and then click **OK**.
