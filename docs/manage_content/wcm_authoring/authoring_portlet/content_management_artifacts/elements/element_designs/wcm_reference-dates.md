**The number of letters determines format:**

-   **Text**

    -   Four or more pattern letters, use full form.
    -   Less than four, use short or abbreviated form if one exists.
    -   **Example: Day/Month/Year**

        -   d,M,y = 3,3,3.
        -   dd,MM,yy = 03,03,03.
        -   dd,MMM,yy = 03,Mar,03.
        -   dd,MMMM,yyyy = 03,March,2003.

**Lowercase and uppercase:**

-   The case of letters that are used in date and time code is not consistent. For example, "M" for month but "d" for day and "y" for year.
-   Uppercase and lowercase letters can mean different things. For example, "s" for second and "S" for millisecond.

**Incorrect format:**

If a date or time code is entered incorrectly, nothing is returned.

**Other characters:**

Any characters in the pattern that are not in the ranges of ['a'..'z'] and ['A'..'Z'] is treated as quoted text. For example, characters like ':', '.', ' ', '\#' and '@' appear in the resulting time text even if they are not embraced within single quotation marks.
