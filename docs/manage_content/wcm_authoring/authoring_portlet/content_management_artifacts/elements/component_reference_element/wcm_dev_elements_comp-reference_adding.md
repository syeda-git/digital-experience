# Adding a Component Reference Element to an Item

You add a component reference element to a site area or content item when you want the component reference to be used for a specific site area or content item.

!!!note
    You can add an element to a content item only if the manage elements tool is enabled in the authoring template that is used by the content item.

1.  Open or create a site area or content item.

2.  Click **Manage Elements**.

3.  Select **Component reference** as the element type.

4.  Enter a name. Do not use double-byte and non-ASCII characters.

5.  Enter a display title to use as the title of the element displayed indexes and forms.

6.  If you create a text provider plug-in for a multi-locale site, you can also select the text provider and enter a key to look up a string from the selected text provider. The text provider displays a different display title for each language it is configured for. The text that is entered in the **Display Title** field is only used if an appropriate display title is not available from the selected text provider, or if the text provider is not available.

7.  Click **Add**. The component reference element is added to your form.

8.  Go to the component reference element you created and click **Select Component** to select the component you want to reference.

9.  Save the item form.
