# Creating a short text component


You create a short text component when you want to reuse a small section of text in multiple places in your website. For example, you can use a short text component to store the name of a product or service.

To create a short text component, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management** and then click **New > Component > Short Text**.
