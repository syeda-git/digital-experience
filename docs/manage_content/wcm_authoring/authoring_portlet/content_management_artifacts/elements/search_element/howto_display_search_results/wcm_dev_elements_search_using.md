# Creating a search component

A search element defines the layout of a form that is used to display search results. To use a search, you must create a search component. You cannot add search elements to authoring templates, sites, site areas, or content items.

To create a search component, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management** and then click **New > Component > Search**.
