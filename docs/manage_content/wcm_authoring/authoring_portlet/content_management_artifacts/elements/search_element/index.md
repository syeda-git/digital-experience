# How to use a search element

A search element is used to display the results of a search query. A search element cannot be used in isolation, but must be used together with an HTML element that is used to define the search query form.

To create a search form, you must:

1.  create a search query by using an HTML element
2.  create a search results view by using a search component

You reference both the HTML element and search component in a single presentation template. The search component is only rendered after a search query is run by a user.
