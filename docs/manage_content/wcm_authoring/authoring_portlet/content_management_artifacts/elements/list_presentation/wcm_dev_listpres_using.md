# List presentation options


The selection items and fields in the list presentation are equivalent to the same fields used in menu and navigator elements.

## How to use a list presentation

The fields in a list presentation are used differently with different component types:

-   **Menus, personalization, and search components:**

    When you create a list presentation to use with a menu, personalization or search component, the following features are not applicable:

    -   Distinguish items with no children because only navigators use hierarchical lists.
    -   Add Result Design because only navigators can use more than one result design field.
-   **Navigators:**

    When you create a navigator, all list presentation fields are applicable. To add extra result designs, click **Add Result Design**.
