# Authoring System Access Strategies

The roles that you assign each library on your authoring system determines what views and features in an authoring portlet are accessible to your users.

Grant each user or group access to roles and item types to match the kind of work they perform. For example:

-   Assign website designers editor access to authoring templates and presentation templates as they are required to create new authoring templates.
-   Assign both website designers and web content authors editor access to components if they are both required to create components.
-   Content approvers are only assigned contributor access to content as they are not required to create new content items, but need approver access to content items during a workflow.
