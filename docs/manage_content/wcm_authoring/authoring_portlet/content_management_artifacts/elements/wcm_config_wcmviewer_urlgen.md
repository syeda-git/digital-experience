# URL generation by Using PathCmpnt and URLCmpnt tags

There are some special considerations to keep in mind when you use `URLCmpnt` and `PathCmpnt` tags to create URLs to other web content items from within your content.

## The URLCmpnt tag

The URL component tag `URLCmpnt` can be used to create URLs to content items in a presentation template. If the attribute `mode="portal"` is set, the content item is displayed through a content viewer portlet.

## The PathCmpnt tag

The path component is used to create the base part of a URL in web content. Typically, the base part is extended by some string that identifies the content to be displayed. If the path component is used inside the context of a web content viewer, the generated URL has the updated URL format and thus cannot be displayed with the traditional web content viewer.

## Adding URL parameters

Adding URL parameters to a regular portal URL do not affect the web content viewer. For this purpose, you must use the `URLCmpnt` or `PathCmpnt` tag. Extra URL query parameters, like those parameters that are used with the traditional web content viewer, can be appended to the URLs generated by these tags.
