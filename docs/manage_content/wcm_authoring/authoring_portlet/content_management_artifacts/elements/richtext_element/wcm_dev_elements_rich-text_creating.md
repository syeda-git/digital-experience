# Creating a rich text component

You create a rich text component when you want to reuse a section of HTML in multiple places in your website, and you want to use a rich text editor to create and edit the HTML. A copyright notice is an example of the kind of HTML you might store in a rich text component.

To create a rich text component, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management** and then click **New > Component > Rich Text**.

1.  [Entering identification information](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_id.md)  
Specify identification information for the current item, including the name and title for the item. The identification section is common to all item forms.
2.  [Specifying a location for an item](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_location.md)  
When you create an item, you can specify the location of the item.
3.  [Using the rich text element](wcm_dev_elements_rich-text_props.md)  
You use the rich text element to enter and format text.
4.  [Entering item properties](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_props.md)  
Specify properties for the current item, including the location of the item and the list of authors and owners that are associated with the item. The item properties section is common to all item forms.
5.  [Granting users or groups access to an item](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/grant_access.md)  
Specify the access control settings for the current item to designate which users have access to an item and their level of access. The access section is common to all item forms.
