# Creating a menu component


You can use a menu element only by creating a menu component. You cannot add a menu element to authoring templates, site areas, or content items.

To create a menu component, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management** and then click **New > Component > Menu**.

1.  [Entering identification information](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_id.md)  
Specify identification information for the current item, including the name and title for the item. The identification section is common to all item forms.
2.  [Specifying a location for an item](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_location.md)  
When you create an item, you can specify the location of the item.
3.  [Defining menu element search properties](./wcm_dev_elements_menu_search.md)  
Specify the search criteria to be used when you generate the menu element. You can limit the search according to the properties of content items, including authoring templates, site areas, categories, and keywords.
4.  [Defining menu element formatting options](./wcm_dev_elements_menu_format.md)  
Define how search results are displayed for the menu element. These options include defining the sort order for results, paging options for menu elements with multiple pages of results, and formatting options that control how the menu is rendered.
5.  [Entering item properties](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_props.md)  
Specify properties for the current item, including the location of the item and the list of authors and owners that are associated with the item. The item properties section is common to all item forms.
6.  [Granting users or groups access to an item](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/grant_access.md)  
Specify the access control settings for the current item to designate which users have access to an item and their level of access. The access section is common to all item forms.
