# Using a user name element

A user name element displays the name of the current user in a presentation template, component design, or element design. You can use a user name element only by creating a user name component. You cannot add a user name element to authoring templates, site areas, or content items.

To create a user name component, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management** and then click **New > Component > User Name**.
