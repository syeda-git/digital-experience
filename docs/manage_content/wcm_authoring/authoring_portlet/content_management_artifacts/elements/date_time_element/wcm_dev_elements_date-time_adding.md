# Adding date and time elements to an Item


You add a date and time element to a site area or content item when you want the date and time element to be used for a specific site area or content item.

!!!note
    You can add an element to a content item only if the manage elements tool is enabled in the authoring template that is used by the content item.

1.  Open or create a site area or content item.

2.  Click **Manage Elements**.

3.  Select **Date and Time** as the element type.

4.  Enter a name. Do not use double-byte and non-ASCII characters.

5.  Enter a display title to use as the title of the element displayed indexes and forms.

6.  If you create a text provider plug-in for a multi-locale site, you can also select the text provider and enter a key to look up a string from the selected text provider. The text provider displays a different display title for each language it is configured for. The text that is entered in the **Display Title** field is only used if an appropriate display title is not available from the selected text provider, or if the text provider is not available.

7.  Click **Add**. The date and time element is added to your form.

8.  Go to the date and time element you created:

    1.  Click **Date** to select a date.

    2.  Click **Time** to enter a time. Only the integers "0123456789" can be used when times are entered.

    !!!note
        Only the integers "0123456789" can be used when times and dates are entered.

9.  Save the item form.
