# File resource element

You can store a file in a file resource element. You can then reference the file resource so that users can download the file by using a link or, for supported file types, convert the file directly to HTML and render it on the page.

By storing a file in a file resource element:

-   You can reference the file anywhere in your site regardless of the original file location or URL.
-   The file is automatically transferred to other servers during syndication.

## Creating a file resource element

To create a file resource element, you can either add a file resource element to an authoring template, site area or content item, or create a file resource component.

**Using a resource content item versus using a file resource component:**

If you configure an authoring template to be a resource template, the content items that are created by using that authoring template are known as resource content items. Like a file resource component, files that are stored within a resource content item can be directly rendered in a web page. The difference between using a resource content item instead of a file resource component is that a resource content item can be listed in navigational components such as menus and navigators.
