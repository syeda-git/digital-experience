# Adding a number element to a template


You add a number element to an authoring template when you want the number element to be used by a set of items that use the same authoring template.

1.  Open or create an authoring template.

2.  Click **Manage Elements**.

3.  Select **Number** as the element type.

4.  Enter a name. Do not use double-byte and non-ASCII characters.

5.  Enter a display title to use as the title of the element displayed indexes and forms.

6.  If you create a text provider plug-in for a multi-locale site, you can also select the text provider and enter a key to look up a string from the selected text provider. The text provider displays a different display title for each language it is configured for. The text that is entered in the **Display Title** field is only used if an appropriate display title is not available from the selected text provider, or if the text provider is not available.

7.  Click **OK**. The number element is added to your form.

8.  Go to the **Default Content** tab.

9.  Go to the number element you created. Enter a numeric value. The maximum number of digits that can be entered into a number element is 16.

10. Click ![properties](../../../../../../images/propIcon.jpg) to open the display properties of the element. This property is where you define how the element is displayed on the item form.

    1.  To display the element as a required field select **Identify this as a required field**.

    2.  To hide a field on the content form from all users select **Hide field**. You must specify a default value if the field is a required field.

        **Note:** Administrators and managers can choose to display hidden fields and elements in an item by clicking **Show hidden fields**.

    3.  If required, enter a minimum and maximum value to restrict the range of numbers that can be entered in the element.

    4.  Select the display format of the number.

    5.  Select whether decimal places are allowed and if so, how many.

    6.  Select the users or groups you want to grant exclusive edit access to a field or element by clicking **Add Editors**.

    7.  Select the users or groups you want to grant exclusive view access to a field or element by clicking **Add Viewers**.

    8.  Type field-specific help into **Field help**. This text displays near the element in the content form.

        If you create a text provider plug-in for a multi-locale site, you can also select the text provider and enter a key to look up a string from the selected text provider. The text provider displays a different help text for each language it is configured for. The text that is entered in the **Field help** field is only used if an appropriate help text is not available from the selected text provider, or if the text provider is not available.

11. Save the authoring template.
