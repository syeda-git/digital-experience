# Changing the order within a taxonomy


As your site evolves, you need to change the structure of a taxonomy.

1.  Select the categories that you would like to reposition.

2.  Click **Move To**.

3.  Select the category that you would like to move.

4.  Click **OK**.

5.  Select a taxonomy or a category to move the category under. Items that you do not have sufficient access to select are disabled. If these items have children you can still browse to select them.

6.  Click **OK**.
