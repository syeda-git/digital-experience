# How to manage a taxonomy

From time to time, you need to edit the structure of a taxonomy.

-   **[Changing the order within a taxonomy](wcm_dev_profiling_taxonomy_editing.md)**  
As your site evolves, you need to change the structure of a taxonomy.
-   **[Copying a category](wcm_dev_profiling_category_copying.md)**  
As a taxonomy evolves, you are required to edit your taxonomy by copying categories from one section of your taxonomy to another. You use the **Copy** feature to copy a category in a taxonomy.
-   **[Moving a category](wcm_dev_profiling_category_moving.md)**  
As a taxonomy evolves, you are required to edit your taxonomy by moving categories from one section of your taxonomy to another. You use the **Move** feature to change the position of a category in a taxonomy. When you reposition a parent category, any child categories are also moved.
