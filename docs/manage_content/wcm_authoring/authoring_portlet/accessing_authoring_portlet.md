# Access the authoring portlet

To access the authoring portlet, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management**.

## Authoring portlet access rights

Access to the different views and items within the authoring portlet are determined by:

-   The role that you are assigned for each web content library.
-   The role that you are assigned for each view within the authoring portlet.
-   The access level that you are assigned for each Web Content Manager item.

## The Web Content Manager Java applet

The first time that you use a Web Content Manager system you will, at some point, be asked to authorize a Java Applet. Click **Grant Always** and the dialog no longer displays.

If you ever receive an error where the "Web Content Manager applet failed to load or is unavailable," you might need to reinstall the applet:

1.  Remove the certificate for the Web Content Manager applet. For example, on a Windowsâ„¢ system, go to **Control Panel > Java Plugin > Certificates**. See your Java documentation for details.
2.  Reinstall or update your JRE.
3.  Open a new HCL Portal session.
4.  Go to the **Web Content Management** tab.
5.  At some point, you might be asked to authorize a Java Applet. Click **Grant Always** and the dialog no longer displays.
