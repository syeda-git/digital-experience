# Labeling a set of items in a library

You can apply a label to the most recent versions of all items in a library. This action does not create a version, it updates the label of the most recent version. If you created a label, you can later restore items in the library based on that label.

You can label only one set of items at a time. You cannot run a second label request until the first request is completed. If you are labeling many items, this action can take some time.

You must be an Administrator to work with web content libraries.

1.  Click the **Administration menu** icon in the toolbar.

2.  Click **Portal Content** \> **Web Content Libraries**.

3.  Click **Additional Tasks** on the library you would like to label.

4.  Click **Label**.

5.  Type a label.

6.  Click **OK**.

7.  Click **Additional Tasks** and then **View Report** to open a list of library label reports.

8.  Click the most recent report to review labeled items.
