# Creating a version action


A version action causes a new version of an item to be created when run.

To create a version action, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management** and then click **New > Workflow Actions > Version Action**.

1.  [Entering identification information](../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_id.md)
Specify identification information for the current item, including the name and title for the item. The identification section is common to all item forms.
2.  [Specifying a location for an item](../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_location.md)
When you create an item, you can specify the location of the item.
3.  [Entering item properties](../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_props.md)
Specify properties for the current item, including the location of the item and the list of authors and owners that are associated with the item. The item properties section is common to all item forms.
4.  [Granting users or groups access to an item](../../content_management_artifacts/common/grant_access.md)
Specify the access control settings for the current item to designate which users have access to an item and their level of access. The access section is common to all item forms.
