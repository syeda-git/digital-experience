# Joint approval

Joint approval is used in cases where approval from multiple users is required before an item is moved to the next stage.

-   You specify which stages you want to be jointly approved.
-   If joint approval is active, then all the approvers that are specified for this stage must approve the document.
-   The exception is an administrator, who can force a document to the next stage.
-   If a group is specified as an approver, only one user per group is required to approve the document.
-   If that user is a member of more than one Group that has Approve access, then all the groups are considered to have approved the document.
