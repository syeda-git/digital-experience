# Defining custom action properties


Define the custom action properties by selecting a custom workflow plug-in and defining related properties.

1.  Select the action to be run by this workflow action.

2.  Select the **Date Type** to use to trigger the custom action.

    -   **Selected date**

        This action is run when the date and time you specified in step 3 is reached.

    -   **Live date**

        This action is run when the publish date specified in an item, plus any offset, is reached.

    -   **Expiry Date**

        This action is run when the expiry date specified in an item, plus any offset, is reached.

    -   **General dates**

        This action is run when either the general date one or two specified in an item, plus any offset, is reached.

    -   **Date entered stage**

        This action is run on the date the item entered the current stage, plus any offset, is reached.

    -   **Custom Action Date**

        This action is run when the date generated by the custom workflow class itself, plus any offset, is reached.

    !!! note
        If you select a date type that requires a date to be set by a user, and no date is set by a user, then the action is not run regardless of whether an offset is selected or not.

3.  If **Selected date** is selected as the date type:

    1.  Click date icon to select a date.

    2.  Click time icon to enter a time. Only the integers "0123456789" can be used when you enter times.

4.  If you select one of the other options, you can choose to use a date offset that will run the custom action based on a time after the selected date type. For example, if you select the date type of "Live date" and define an offset of one month, the custom action is run exactly one month after the item reached the live date and time.

    1.  Click **Enable Offset**.

    2.  Enter the number of months, days, hours, or minutes to offset by.

    3.  Select either "after specified date" or "before specified date".

    4.  If you select either "Months" or "Days" you can also specify the time of day to run the action by selecting **Time to run action after offset has been reached**. For example, if you select one month plus 9 am, then the action will run at 9 am, one month after the selected date type is reached.

5.  In some circumstances, the date that is specified in the scheduled action has been reached when an item enters a stage. In this case, by default the action is automatically run as soon the item reaches the current stage. You can choose to not run the action if the date is reached by selecting **Do not run the action if date has already been reached**.
