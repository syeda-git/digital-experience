# Change Management

HCL DX provides features for managing change to web content and associated artifacts, including [sites built on the platform](../../../../build_sites/index.md). The three main capabilities described in this section are versioning, workflow and projects.

## What Is It For?

The change management features are aimed at controlling publication and expiration of content. Workflows enable you to gather approvals for changes to content, and to schedule those changes. Projects group together multiple changes to allow a coordinated set of changs to be made all at once. Versioning allows you to keep track of how your content has changed over time.

## Who Should Use It?

This information is primarily aimed at non-technical users who are responsible for organizing and managing content. **Content strategists** can use the organizational features of HCL DX to structure web content and organize templates and reusable components of various types. **Content authors** can use the content editing capabilities to create and manage individual content items. Both may interact with people who are not regular users of DX for publication approvals, via workflow and projects.

Additionally, develpers may be involved to extend workflow capabilities, which is also described in this section.

- [Managing labels](wcm_managing_labels.md) - You can apply a label to the most recent versions of all items in a library. This action does not create a version, it updates the label of the most recent version. If you created a label, you can later restore items in the library based on that label.
