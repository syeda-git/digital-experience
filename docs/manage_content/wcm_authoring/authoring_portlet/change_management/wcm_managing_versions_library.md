# Restoring items in a library

You can restore a set of items within a library that either have the same label or were versioned at, or before, a specified date and time.

-   You can restore only one set of items at a time. You cannot run a second restore request until the first request is completed. If you are restoring many items, this action might take some time.
-   When you restore items that contain links or references to other items, if the original item no longer exists you are prompted to select a new item to link or reference.
-   You must be an Administrator to work with web content libraries.
-   A library cannot be restored while there are any items currently locked or checked out by users. Before you restore a library you, must view all published items in a library and unlock any items marked as checked out or locked.
-   Labels that you apply to versions are not syndicated to subscribers.
