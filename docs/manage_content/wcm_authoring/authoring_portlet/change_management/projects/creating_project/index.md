# Creating a project

You use a project to manage changes to a set of items.

To create a project, open the applications menu and go to **Content > Web Content Management** and then click **New > Project**. You then either select the default template, or one of the project templates you have access to.


1.  [Entering identification information](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_id.md)  
Specify identification information for the current item, including the name and title for the item. The identification section is common to all item forms.
2.  [Manage items in a project](wcm_dev_projects_items.md)  
You can both create new items or add existing items to a project and then edit them as required.
3.  [Defining project approval settings](wcm_dev_projects_form_approval.md)  
If you want a project to be reviewed before it is published, you must select at least one approver in the approval section.
4.  [Applying custom actions to a project](wcm_dev_projects_form_custom_action.md)  
You can apply custom workflow actions to the different states of a project. These actions can be used to trigger different actions during the life of a project. The actions are run when a project enters a state that the action is assigned to.
5.  [Entering item properties](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/items_props.md) 
Specify properties for the current item, including the location of the item and the list of authors and owners that are associated with the item. The item properties section is common to all item forms.
6.  [Granting users or groups access to an item](../../../content_management_artifacts/common/grant_access.md) 
Specify the access control settings for the current item to designate which users have access to an item and their level of access. The access section is common to all item forms.
