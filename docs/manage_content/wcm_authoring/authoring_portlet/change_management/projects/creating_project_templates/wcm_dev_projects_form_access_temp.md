# Template defined project access settings

Define the default access settings for any projects that are created by using a project template.

Users and groups can be assigned the roles of user, contributor, editor or manager. Inheritance cannot be set in the project template.

To grant users or groups access to an item:

1.  Go to the **Template Defined Access** section of the project template form.

2.  To select specific users or groups instead of using inheritance, click **Grant Access** for each role.

    1.  Enter at least two characters in the **Search** field and then click **Search**.

    2.  Select the required users or groups and then click **Add**.

    3.  Click **OK**.

3.  To grant access to virtual users, use the menu next to each **Grant Access** to select either:

    -   Anonymous portal user
    -   All authenticated portal users
    -   All users
    -   Authors
    -   Owners
    -   Creator
