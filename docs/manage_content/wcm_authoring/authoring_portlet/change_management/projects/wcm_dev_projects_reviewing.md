# Project review state

If you select at least one approver for a project, the project must be submitted for review before it can be published.

To enforce a review, a user with editor access or higher clicks **Submit for Review** from the toolbar when all the items in the project are "pending". A project can either require the approval of only a single approver or all approvers. Only when the project is approved will the project itself become pending. The project is then either automatically or manually published depending on how the project is configured.

When a project is in the review state:

-   Users with editor access or higher can return a project to an active state by clicking **Withdraw from Review**.
-   Approvers can approve a project by clicking **Approve Project**. A project can either require the approval of only a single approver or all approvers.
-   Approvers can decline a project by clicking **Reject Project**. The project is returned to the active state.
-   If joint approval is specified, approvers can withdraw an approval while the project is still in review by clicking **Withdraw Approval**. The users's approval is withdrawn, but the project remains in a state of review.
