# Projects and custom workflow actions

Each workflow stage contains default actions, but you can also create custom workflow actions by creating a custom workflow plug-in.

You can assign custom workflow actions to run when a project enters a specific state in a project. For example, you might a create custom workflow action that can:

-   verify web standards compliance for all assets within the project that includes items that are not traditionally workflowed, such as components and presentation templates.
-   automatically reject a project if it is in review for a certain period.
-   automatically delete a project when it is successfully published.
