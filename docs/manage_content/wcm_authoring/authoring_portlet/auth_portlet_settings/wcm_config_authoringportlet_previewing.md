# Defining preview options

The preview options determine how content can be previewed. Preview options are defined within the Previewing Options section.

1.  Select **Allow authors to preview content in a Web page** to allow users to preview pages with the Web Content Manager servlet.

2.  To allow users to preview content in portal pages, you must select specific portal pages from the list that is located under **Allow authors to preview content in the local portal pages selected**. The portal pages that are displayed here are the pages available on the same instance of the portal where your Web Content Manager application is installed. The selected pages must contain a web content viewer to display the content.

3.  To allow users to preview content in a portlet that is on a different portal server, you must enter the URL to the remote portal page in the **Allow authors to preview content using the following URLs** field. The portal pages that are entered here must contain a web content viewer to display the content.


!!! note
    When you use a web content viewer to preview content, ensure that the web content viewer is configured to receive links from **Other portlets and this portlet**.
