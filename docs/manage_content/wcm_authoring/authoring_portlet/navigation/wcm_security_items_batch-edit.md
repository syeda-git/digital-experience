# Batch-editing access controls

An administrator can apply access control settings for multiple items.

To batch-edit security:

1.  Open an item view.
2.  Select the items that you would like to batch-edit, and then click **More Actions** \> **Set Access**.
3.  If you are assigning access to individual users or groups, edit the list of users or groups you would like to set security levels for.
    -   To remove items, first select the required items from the item list, then click **Remove**
    -   To add items, click **Add** Search for and then select the users or groups you would like to add Security for. Click **OK**.

4.  Select how to apply the new access levels:
    -   **The same access level** changes the access level of the selected users or groups to the specific access level selected in step 5.
    -   **Minimum access level** changes the minimum access level of the selected users or groups to the access level selected in step 5. The access levels of a user can be raised, but not reduced.
    -   **Maximum access level** changes the maximum access level of the selected users or groups to the access level selected in step 5. The access levels of a user can be reduced, but not raised.
    
5.  Select an access level.
6.  Select inheritance options as required. If you select "ignore", no changes are applied to inheritance.
7.  Select to apply these settings either to the **Administrator Defined** or **User Defined** access control settings.
8.  Select **Only change access for existing users or groups. Do not add any new users or groups** to change the access level of users and groups that already have access to an item. No new users or groups are added.
9.  Click **OK** to finish.
