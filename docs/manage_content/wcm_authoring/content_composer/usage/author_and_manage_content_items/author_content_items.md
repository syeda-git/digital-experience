# Author Content Items

This section provides the steps on how to author a web content item using HCL Content Composer.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisite}

Content Composer should be installed and configured to HCL Digital Experience 9.5 container release update CF181 or higher. See instructions to install to supported container environments in the [Install HCL Digital Experience 9.5 Components](../../installation/install_config_cc_dam.md) topic.

Content Composer is accessible from the Practitioner Studio interface (after image configuration to your HCL Digital Experience 9.5 CF181 and higher deployment).

Before you can use AI-assistance features for sentiment analysis of content, keyword extraction from content, and auto summarization of content element in Content Composer, refer to the following steps to enable AI Analysis:

- [Web content AI analysis for Kubernetes Deployment](../../../../../get_started/plan_deployment/container_deployment/wcm_content_ai_analysis.md)
- [Web content AI analysis for on-premise deployment](../../../../../get_started/plan_deployment/traditional_deployment/wcm_env/wcm_ai_analysis.md)
    
For instructions on how to use the AI-assistance features, see [Web Content Manager REST V2 APIs for AI content analysis](../../../../../manage_content/wcm_development/wcm_rest_v2_ai_analysis/index.md).
