# XML configuration interface parameters for the Web Content Viewer

As with other portlets in your portal, you can use the XML configuration interface \(xmlaccess command\) to deploy and configure the Web Content Viewer. To simplify the configuration of the portlet with the XML configuration interface, the portlet parameters you can specify accept path values in addition to the standard IDs.

By default, the Web Content Viewer is configured with unique IDs. This has the advantage that the configuration does not break if an item is renamed of moved. However, when you are configuring a portlet with the XML configuration interface, it can be difficult to determine the unique ID of an item. When you are configuring the Web Content Viewer, you can reference web content items by their path, as well as by their IDs, by using the following parameters:

-   **`AUTHORINGTEMPLATE_OVERRIDE`**

    Specifies the authoring templates of the profile section. The parameter can contain multiple values, which are separated by commas. The list can contain both ID and path values.

-   **`CATEGORY_OVERRIDE`**

    Specifies the categories of the profile section. To list multiple categories, separate the categories by commas. You can use both ID values and path values.

-   **`SITEAREA_OVERRIDE`**

    Specifies the site areas of the profile section. To list multiple site areas, separate the site areas by commas. You can use both ID values and path values.

-   **`WCM_BROADCASTS_TO`**

    Specifies the link broadcasting setting for the Web Content Viewer. Values include:

    -   `WCM_LINKING_DYNAMIC`: Information about the web content item that is displayed in the Web Content Viewer is used to dynamically determine to which page the context is broadcast.
    -   `WCM_LINKING_SELF`: The context of the current Web Content Viewer is broadcast to other Web Content Viewers on the same portal page.
    -   `WCM_LINKING_OTHER`: The context of the current Web Content Viewer is broadcast to other Web Content Viewers on another portal page, as specified by the `WCM_PORTAL_PAGE_ID` parameter.
    -   `WCM_LINKING_NONE`: The context of the current Web Content Viewer is not broadcast to other Web Content Viewers.

-   **`WCM_COMPONENT_IDR`**

    Specifies a library component and is only used if content type **Component** is selected.

    Specifies the name of the element to be displayed, when the `WCM_CONTENT_TYPE` parameter has the value `CONTENT_COMPONENT`.

-   **`WCM_DESIGN_IDR`**

    Specifies an alternative presentation template.

-   **`WCM_LISTENS_TO`**

    Specifies how the Web Content Viewer is configured to receive links that are broadcast from other Web Content Viewers. Values include:

    -   `WCM_LINKING_OTHER`: Information is received from any Web Content Viewer broadcasting links.

-   **`WCM_PORTAL_PAGE_ID`**

    Specifies the unique name or object ID of the page, which is the target for link broadcasts when the `WCM_BROADCASTS_TO` parameter is set to `WCM_LINKING_OTHER`.

-   **`WCM_PORTLET_TITLE`**

    Used with the `WCM_PORTLET_TITLE_TYPE` parameter, this parameter specifies the portlet title for the Web Content Viewer. Values include:

    -   The user-defined title for the portlet, if the `WCM_PORTLET_TITLE_TYPE` parameter has a value of `WCM_PORTLET_TITLE_TYPE_GENERAL`.
    -   The name of the resource bundle containing the title for the portlet, if the `WCM_PORTLET_TITLE_TYPE` parameter has a value of `WCM_PORTLET_TITLE_TYPE_RESBUN`.

    Specifies how the portlet title is displayed for the Web Content Viewer. Values include:

    -   `WCM_PORTLET_TITLE_TYPE_DYN_CONTENT_CMPNT`: The title is defined by the value of an element of the content item that is displayed in the Web Content Viewer. You must also specify the element name using the `WCM_PORTLET_TITLE` parameter.

When specifying a content path, you must begin with the forward slash character \(`/`\) followed by the library name, as indicated in the following examples of valid content paths:

```
/mylib/myfolder/mysitearea/mycontent
```

or

```
/mylib/mypresentationtemplate
```

!!! note
    If you configure an item by its path rather than by its ID, the portlet configuration can become invalid if the item is renamed or moved. If an item has been configured by its path, the Web Content Viewer displays a small path icon after the item when you are in the **Edit Shared Settings** or **Configure** mode.

!!! important
    When configuring an item by its path, you cannot build the path from the **Display title** fields of the items in the path. You must use the **Name** fields of the items when specifying the path.
