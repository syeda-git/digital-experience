# Member fixer with syndication

You can configure your system to automatically run the member fixer tool when syndicating. The member fixer is run on the subscriber during syndication. It is run against items that have just been syndicated. Details of the member fixer operations are included in the syndication report.

To run the member fixer during syndication add or update the following properties in the `WCM WCMConfigService` service using the WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console:

|Parameter|Details|
