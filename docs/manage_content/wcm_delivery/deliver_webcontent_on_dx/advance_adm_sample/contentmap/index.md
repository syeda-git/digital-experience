# Content associations reference

Content associations are used to associate web content pages with your web content site structure. When you select a folder to associate with a web content page, a content association is created and maintained within the portal.

Typically, the management of content associations is automatically handled by the portal. However, for situations where you want to work directly with content associations, several mechanisms are available: the XML configuration interface, the Portal Scripting Interface, and the REST API for content associations.


-   **[XML configuration interface and content associations](mp_wcm_contentmap_xml.md)**  
With the XML configuration interface \(xmlaccess command\), you can perform batch updates of content associations or export associations to import into another portal. Content association information is represented in the XML configuration schema by content-mapping-info elements.
-   **[Portal Scripting Interface and content associations](mp_wcm_contentmap_pscript.md)**  
With the Portal Scripting Interface, you can create scripts to automate the management of content associations. Using the ContentMapping bean with the Portal Scripting Interface, you can add, modify, and remove content associations.
-   **[REST API and content associations](mp_wcm_contentmap_restapi.md)**  
If you are creating or extending an application and want to manage content associations with that application, you can use portal remote APIs. These APIs retrieve a list of content associations and then create, update, or delete associations.
