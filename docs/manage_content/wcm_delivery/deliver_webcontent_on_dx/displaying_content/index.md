# Displaying content with Web Content Viewers

Display content from your web content system by adding a Web Content Viewer to the server where you want the content to show.

If your presentation is simple, a single Web Content Viewer can be sufficient. You can also use multiple Web Content Viewers to provide a richer experience for your users.

Depending on how you decide to deploy the servers in your environment, there are different ways to render content:

-   You can install a Web Content Viewer locally on the same portal server where Web Content Manager is installed.
-   You can install the viewer remotely on a different portal server.

-   **[Adding a Web Content Viewer Portlet](wcm_config_wcmviewer_adding.md)**  
Add a Web Content Viewer Portlet to a page with the site toolbar.
-   **[Creating a web content page](mp_wcm_createpage.md)**  
A web content page is a page that is associated to one or more site areas in HCL Web Content Manager. You can create a web content page from a web content template page, or you can convert an existing DX page into a web content page.
