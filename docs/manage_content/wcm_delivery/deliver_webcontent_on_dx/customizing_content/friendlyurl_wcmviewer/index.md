# Friendly URLs and Web Content Viewers

Friendly URLs provide a way for you to define a custom address for a DX page that is easy to remember and share. The Web Content Viewer expands on friendly URL support so you can specify extra path information in the friendly URL.

By defining friendly URLs for your DX pages, users can browse the portal by using more concise URLs that better reflect the page structure. The additional path information in a friendly URL for web content points to a content item to be displayed in the Web Content Viewer.
