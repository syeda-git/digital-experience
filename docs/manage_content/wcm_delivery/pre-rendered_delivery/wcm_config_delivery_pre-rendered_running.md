# Pre-render methods

Pre-rendering can be configured to run automatically, or you can manually pre-render a website by using a URL.

**Administrator access:** To pre-render a website, you must have administrator access to the library that contains the site area.

## Automatically pre-rendering a website

Pre-rendering can be run according to the cacher settings specified for the **WCM WCMConfigService** service as part of the pre-rendering configuration.

## Manually pre-rendering a website

Pre-rendering can also be initiated through the URL interface. For example:

http://host\_name:port\_number/wps/wcm/connect?MOD=Cacher&SRV=cacheSite&sitearea=sitearea\_name&library=library\_name

|Service|Required Parameters|Optional Parameters|
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
|SRV=cacheSiteInitializes pre-rendering for the site area with a delay as given \(in seconds\).|`sitearea=`site area name|DELAY=<delay\>LIBRARY=<library\> <br> **Note:** If no library is specified, the default library is used, as specified by the `defaultLibrary` property in the `WCM WCMConfigService` service.|
|SRV=flushSiteCacheClears \(flushes\) the site cache. Deletes all pre-rendered data.|`sitearea=`site area name|LIBRARY=<library\> <br>**Note:** If no library is specified, the default library is used, as specified by the `defaultLibrary` property in the `WCM WCMConfigService` service.|
|SRV=flushPageCacheFlushes the page from the site cache. The site area and page are determined from the request URL.| | |
|No SRV specifiedThe CacherModule attempts to retrieve the page from the cache.| | |

## Pre-rendering individual content items

You can also pre-render individual content items by using the following URL:

http://host\_name:port\_number/wps/wcm/connect/library\_name/site\_area\_name/content?MOD=Cacher

!!! note
    -   To pre-render individual content items, the site area that is specified in the URL must either be a site area set in connect.moduleconfig.cacher.task.siteareas in the **WCM WCMConfigService** service, or you must have previously manually pre-rendered the site area using "SRV=cacheSite" so that the site area already exists in the location you pre-render to.
