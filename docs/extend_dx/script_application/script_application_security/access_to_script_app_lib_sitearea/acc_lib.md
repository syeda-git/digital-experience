# Granting access to the Script Application Library

You can grant editor and reviewer access to the Script Application Library to additional users or groups. Users who push Script Application instances to the server must have these access roles set for them.

1.  Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal Content** \> **Web Content Libraries**.

2.  Click **Library Resources** for the **Script Application Library**.

3.  Click **Set Permissions** for the **Content** area within the library.

4.  Click **Edit role** for the **Editor** and **Reviewer** roles and set the appropriate members of these roles based on who can perform those roles. These members have access in addition to the default `wpsadmins` group.
