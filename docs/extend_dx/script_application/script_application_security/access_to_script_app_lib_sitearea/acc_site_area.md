# Granting access to the Script Applications Site Area

The command line `sp-push` utility, when you push a Script Application that is not associated with a project, creates and approves newly created content. The user who runs a push requires both Editor and Reviewer role membership to run the push. By default, members of the `wpsadmins` group are both Editors and Reviewers, but you can specify extra users or groups.

1.  In the Web Content Manager Authoring Portlet, select **Script Application Library**.

2.  Select the **Content** folder and ensure that the **Script Applications** check box is selected.

3.  Click **Edit** and switch to the **Properties** tab. Then, locate the **Access** section of the properties listing.

4.  Specify the appropriate users or groups of users who can perform the **Edit** and **Reviewer** roles for this default Script Applications area.
