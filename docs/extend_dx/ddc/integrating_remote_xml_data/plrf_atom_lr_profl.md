# The Atom list-rendering profile

Digital Data Connector \(DDC\) for HCL Portal provides a list-rendering profile that is ready to use for access to feeds that comply with the Atom syndication format standard.

This profile is named ibm.portal.atom. The profile is deployed as custom properties of the WP List Rendering Profile Service resource environment provider in the WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console. To display the profile, open the Custom Properties view of that resource environment provider in the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console and activate a key filter by specifying `atom.*`.

To use this profile in your lists, set the profile attribute of the `ListRenderingContext` rendering plug-in tag to the value `ibm.portal.atom`. Example:

```
[Plugin:ListRenderingContext action="set" extension-id="ibm.portal.ddc.xml" 
   profile="ibm.portal.atom" 
   attribute="source=https://www.cntserv_exmp.com/connections/communities/service/atom/catalog/public"
   compute="always"]
```
