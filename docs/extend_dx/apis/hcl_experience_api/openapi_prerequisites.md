# Prerequisites

The HCL Experience API requires software prerequisites to successfully run. The build package also includes this information, along with the installation and configuration steps.

The Experience API consists of multiple parts: Ring API, DAM API, Image-processor API, and each one is delivered through separate containers. These are all typically deployed on Kubernetes but the Ring API can also be run locally in Docker for development. The following steps are applied to the locally running Ring API part of Experience API.
