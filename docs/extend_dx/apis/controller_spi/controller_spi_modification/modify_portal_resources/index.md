# Modifying Portal Resources and Topologies

The Controller SPI allows you to modify portal resources and the topology of your portal in different ways.

You can make the following modifications:

-   Create new resources
-   Insert new resources into the portal topology
-   Move existing resources
-   Delete existing resources.

Depending on the resource that you create or modify, you can perform different types of modifications. For more detailed information about each of these refer to the following topics.

-   **[Creating resources](../modify_portal_resources/creating_resources/index.md)**  
You create resources by using methods of controllers. Each controller type enables the specific resources for its type of model.
-   **[Moving or Inserting Nodes](../modify_portal_resources/moving_inserting_nodes/index.md)**  
To move existing nodes or insert new nodes, use the `insert()` method of the controller.
-   **[Deleting Nodes](ctrlrapit_del_nodes.md)**  
To delete nodes, use the `delete()` method of the controller.
