# Module framework for IBM MobileFirst

The module framework allows extensions to contribute to different areas of a page to provide flexibility, enhance the user experience, and maximize performance.

HCL Digital Experience provides the MobileFirstÂ® 7.0 resources by default through modules that are defined in the default profiles. These modules use prerequisites to ensure that all necessary resources are aggregated and device classes to ensure that they are only provided for a particular environment. For more information, see [The module framework](../../../../build_sites/themes_skins/the_module_framework/index.md).
