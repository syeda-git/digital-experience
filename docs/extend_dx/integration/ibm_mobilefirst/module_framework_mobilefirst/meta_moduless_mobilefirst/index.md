# Meta-Modules for IBM MobileFirst integration

MobileFirst provides a set of ready-to-use modules.

These MobileFirstÂ® integration modules are not associated with a specific release. You can define which version of MobileFirst or Worklight to use.

The Meta-Module definitions are stored in the following files:

-   mobilefirst70.json
-   dav:fs-type1/themes/Portal8.5/contributions/mobilefirst70.json
-   If you want to use a previous version of MobileFirst, other versions are available at PortalServer/theme/wp.theme.worklight.ext/installedApps/wp.theme.worklight.ext.ear/wp.theme.worklight.ext.war/worklight version/

You can have only one file in the folder at one time because the contribution files are not supported at the same time. Specific MobileFirst Integration modules are listed in the MobileFirst 6.1 Integration sections.

## MobileFirst Meta-Modules

-   wp\_worklight\_ext
-   wp\_worklight
-   wp\_worklight\_css
-   wp\_worklight\_css\_android
-   wp\_worklight\_css\_ios
-   wp\_worklight\_jsonstore

## MobileFirst 7.0 Integration

These modules initialize the MobileFirst Client and Cordova API to enable support for native device capabilities and other functions of the MobileFirst server. The modules are only aggregated when accessed through the MobileFirst hybrid shell.

The plugin.xml file location is [PortalServer\_root](../../../../../guide_me/wpsdirstr.md)/theme/wp.theme.worklight.ext/installableApps/wp.theme.worklight.ext.ear/wp.theme.worklight.ext.war/WEB-INF/plugin.xml

For more information about these modules, their prerequisites or runtime activation, use the Theme Analyzer Portlet.
