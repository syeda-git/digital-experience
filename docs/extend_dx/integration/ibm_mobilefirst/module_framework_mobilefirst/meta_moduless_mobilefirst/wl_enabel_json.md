# Enabling JSON store module

JSONStore features add the ability to store JSON documents in IBM MobileFirst applications.

JSONStore is a lightweight, document-oriented storage system that is included as a feature of MobileFirstÂ®, and enables persistent storage of JSON documents by using JavaScript API. Documents in an application are available in JSONStore even when the device that runs the application is offline. This persistent, always-available storage gives customers, employees, or users access to documents when for example there is no network connection to the device.

1.  Create page.

2.  Place your custom portlet with the JSON store feature on the page that you created.

3.  Edit the page profile and add the module `wp_mobilefirst_jsonstore` to the profile and save it.
