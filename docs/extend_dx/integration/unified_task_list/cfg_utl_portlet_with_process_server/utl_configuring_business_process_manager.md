# Configuring an IBM Business Process Manager

This task provider retrieves tasks from IBM Business Process Manager and surfaces them in the Unified Task List portlet.

1.  Open the applications menu and go to **Collaboration** \> **Unified Task List**.

2.  Open the page with the Unified Task List portlet on it.

3.  Configure the Unified Task List portlet to add task provider instances for Business Process Manager. For more information, see [Configuring an IBM Business Process Manager task provider instance](../utl_for_adm/creating_task_provider_instance/utl_cfg_bpm_tsk_prvdr.md).

4.  Create a task handler for the process instances of Business Process Manager. For more information, see [Adding a task handler](../utl_for_adm/utl_add_task_handler.md).

5.  Open the applications menu and go to **Collaboration** \> **Unified Task List**.

6.  Add the Coach portlet to the Unified Task List page.

7.  Configure the Coach portlet with host name and port number of the Business Process Manager server. For more information, see [Configuring the Coach portlets for WebSphere Lombardi Edition and WebSphere Business Process Manager](https://help.hcltechsw.com/digital-experience/9.5/panel_help/utl_configuring_websphere_lombardi_edition_coach_portlets.html).

8.  Add wires to link the Coach portlet and the Unified Task List portlet. For more information on adding wires, see [Adding a wire](../../../../deployment/manage/portal_admin_tools/portal_user_interface/managing_pages/portlet_wires/portlet_wires_using_page_layout/h_wires_add.md) in the related links.

9.  Claim a Business Process Manager task and then select it to start the process instance in the Coach portlet.
