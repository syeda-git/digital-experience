# Task providers

Task providers are services that access back-end systems to retrieve tasks. The task providers also use a Web Experience Factory Transform builder to provide a uniform data set that displays in the Unified Task List user interface.

You can create multiple task providers to aggregate tasks from several back-end systems. For example, you can create a task provider to access, retrieve, and format tasks from a particular back-end system. You can then create another task provider to access, retrieve, and format tasks from a different back-end system. The result of these two task providers is that a single set of tasks displays in the user interface, but originate from two different back-end systems.
