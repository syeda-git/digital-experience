# Configuring the Unified Task List portlet

You can configure the Unified Task List portlet to retrieve tasks and forms from IBM Business Process Manager and Forms Experience Builder.

-   **[Configuring Unified Task List portlet for single sign-on](utl_configuring_your_environment_for_the_unified_task_list_portlet.md)**  
 Set up a single sign-on between IBM Business Process Manager, Forms Experience Builder, and HCL Portal. Single sign-on (SSO) provides a secure method of authenticating a user within an environment and applies that authentication to access other applications, systems, and networks during the session.
-   **[Configuring Unified Task List portlet at run time](cfg_utl_portlet_at_runtime/index.md)**  
You can customize the Unified Task List portlet at run time as a HCL Portal administrator. Customizing at run time involves accessing the deployed Unified Task List to configure the portlet settings.
