# Configuring Unified Task List portlet for single sign-on

Set up a single sign-on between IBM Business Process Manager, Forms Experience Builder, and HCL Portal. Single sign-on \(SSO\) provides a secure method of authenticating a user within an environment and applies that authentication to access other applications, systems, and networks during the session.

In the context of the Unified Task List portlet, single sign-on enables communication between HCL Portal, IBM® Business Process Manager, and Forms Experience Builder. Because the single sign-on and LTPA configuration settings are WebSphere® Application Server security settings, it can be applied to any server that runs on WebSphere Application Server.

See the WebSphere Application Server documentation for details on how to configure single sign-on and LTPA between the two servers.
