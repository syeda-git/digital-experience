# Adding, editing, and removing filters

Filters provide specialized views for tasks. You can separate tasks according to the back-end systems where the tasks originate, or by a particular context. When you add filters, the Unified Task List portlet displays tasks that are separated according to the task provider instance. For example, you can add a filter for tasks that come from IBMÂ® Business Process Manager so that these tasks are not displayed with other Unified Task List portlet tasks.
