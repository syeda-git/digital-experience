# Changing the number of rows in the task list table

The task list table contains rows of tasks that users can select. You can edit the task list table to display a specific number of rows per page in the Unified Task List portlet. You can specify any number of rows per page, however, if there are fewer tasks than the number of rows available, the Unified Task List portlet displays only the rows that contain tasks. If there are more tasks than the number of rows available, the Unified Task List portlet displays a link to another page for those tasks.

1.  Log in to HCL Portal with administrative access to the Unified Task List portlet.

2.  From the main page of the Unified Task List portlet, hover the cursor over the title bar to access the portlet menu and select **Personalize**. The **User Interface Settings** window opens.

3.  In the **Paging Size** field, enter the number of rows that you want to display per page in the task list table.

4.  Select **Save**.
