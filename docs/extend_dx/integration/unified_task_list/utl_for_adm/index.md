# Unified Task List


Integrate business workflow process in to your site.

1.  [Create a task provider instance](../utl_for_adm/creating_task_provider_instance/index.md)  
 A task provider instance contains a set of parameters that are required to connect to a business process management system. It also includes a unique ID to map the parameters to the appropriate task provider.
2.  [Adding a task handler](utl_add_task_handler.md)  
The task handler defines what the Unified Task List Portlet does when a user selects a task to advance a workflow. The task handler determines how the Unified Task List Portlet connects to the tasks that the users must complete.
3.  [Removing task handlers](utl_remove_task_handlers.md)  
 Two Coach portlets are already installed in HCL Portal: one for use on a dynamic portal page and the other on a portal page. Both Coach portlets offer the same function in both page contexts. When a WebSphereÂ® Lombardi Edition task and WebSphere Business Process Manager task is selected in the Unified Task List portlet it displays the corresponding coach in the Coach portlet.
