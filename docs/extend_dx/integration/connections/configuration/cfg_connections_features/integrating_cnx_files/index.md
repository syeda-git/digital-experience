# Integrating HCL Connections files

To integrate files with your portal, register the Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) entry points with the WP FederatedDocumentsService resource environment provider. After this configuration is complete, content authors insert links to documents hosted on the HCL Connections server. Using personalization, authors can also render inventories of folders that are hosted in files.

Authors can use the generic CMIS file picker dialog, in the HCL Web Content Manager rich text editor, to insert links to documents hosted on HCL Connections files. Authors can also use the personalization component in Web Content Manager to render inventories of folders on the HCL Connections server.
