- **[Configure HCL Connections on-premise](../cfg_portal_with_cnx/connections_onpremise/index.md)**  
Bring the power of HCL Connections to your portal applications.
- **[Configuring Security for HCL Connections](../cfg_portal_with_cnx/connections_deploying/index.md)**  
Bring the power of HCL Connections to your portal applications.
- **[Configuring common Directory Services for your security configuration](../cfg_portal_with_cnx/cfg_common_dir/t_connections_portlets_common_directory.md)**  
Configure the common Directory Services to work with your security configuration.
- **[Set up Ajax proxy](../cfg_portal_with_cnx/setup_ajax/index.md)**  
The support for community pages uses the Ajax proxy to access the remote server. The Ajax proxy is updated for the base Connections URLS during the HCL Connections Portlets installation. If FileNet is used, you must still configure the Ajax proxy manually to update for FileNet. Configure the Ajax proxy so that direct requests that the CCM portlet makes to the FileNet server are allowed to pass through the proxy Server.
- **[Configuring common directory service](../cfg_portal_with_cnx/cfg_common_dir/index.md)**  
HCL Connections use the common Directory Services to enable directory lookup from HCL Connections in the HCL Portal environment.
- **[Optional and recommended configuration](../cfg_portal_with_cnx/optional_config/index.md)**  
Depending on your deployment, follow these steps to optimize the HCL Connections portlets.
- **[Addressing HCL Connections content from a portlet](../cfg_portal_with_cnx/connections_poc/index.md)**  
Use custom URIs to identify, access, and display HCL Connections in a portlet.
