# Setting the Search Scope

Define search scopes for the content from HCL Connections that is returned from a search in HCL Digital Experience applications.

After the service or collection is defined, you can optionally define search scopes to make available to users. A search scope defines different levels of granularity at which the search is executed from the Portal user interface.

1.  To open the **Manage Search** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Search Administration** \> **Manage Search**.

2.  In the Manage Search section, click **Search Scope**.

3.  Click **New Scope**.

4.  Specify a name for the scope and click **Select Location** to select the services and collections to include.

    This view enables you to mix and match various services and content sources and to define the granularity of the search scope.
