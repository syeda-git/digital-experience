# Configuring HCL Connections on-premise

You can deploy community pages, which are portal pages that are associated with communities from HCL Connections communities. Portlets on community pages are automatically scoped to the community membership and display content from the community in the portlets. For example, if your community contains a forum, add the forum portlet to a community page, for portal users to view and interact with the forum content from a Portal application.

-   **[Configuring authentication](../connections_onpremise/connections_authentication/index.md)**  
Set up single sign-on integration between HCL Connections and HCL Portal with third-party security products, or configure basic authentication to enable access to the portlets.
