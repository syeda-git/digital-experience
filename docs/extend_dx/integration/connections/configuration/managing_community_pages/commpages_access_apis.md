# Community associations and APIs

Although community associations are typically managed through the portal user interface, you might want to access the associations programmatically.

For example, a portlet on a specific page might need to communicate with a community in HCL Connections that is associated with the page. For this type of access, the content mapping service supports several APIs:

-   Java API
-   REST API
-   Portal Scripting Interface
-   XML configuration interface (xmlaccess command)

The content mapping service provides general access to associations of portal resources with other types of resources. Associations to resources of different types are grouped together and separated from one another by scopes. Community associations are managed in the `ibm.connections` scope.
