# Creating community associations during page template instantiation

When creating a page template, you can require that a community association is created when a page is created from the template.

When creating the community association, you have several options:

-   You can associate the new page with a community that is automatically created during page template instantiation.
-   You can associate the new page with a community that is associated with the parent page of the new page.
-   You can associate the new page with a specific community that already exists.

!!!important
    To create communities automatically when creating pages from a template, the user creating the page must be authorized on the HCL Connections server to create communities.

-   **[Creating communities during community page instantiation](commpages_create_mapping_newcomm.md)**  
When you create a template for a community page, you can configure the template to create a community when you create a page from the template.
-   **[Creating associations to existing communities during page instantiation](commpages_create_mapping_exist.md)**  
When you create a template for a community page, you can configure the template to associate the page created from the template with an existing community. In this case, the community is not modified in any way.
