# Using the Web Application Bridge

The Web Application Bridge uses reverse proxy technology to integrate web-based content providers, such as the Microsoft SharePoint server, with HCL Digital Experience.

Administrators must first create the content providers profiles, policies, and web dock applications. Content authors can add the applications to a page without requiring direct network access to the backend application. A special engine maps Uniform Resource Identifier (URIs) on the iFrame portlet to real URIs from the content providers.
