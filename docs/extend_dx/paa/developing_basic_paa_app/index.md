# Developing basic PAA file applications

Solution developers can create their own Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) files. The developers can then use the Configuration Wizard to add on their applications to their HCL Digital Experience environment.

Review the following requirements before you create your own Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) file:

-   **[Checking server dependency](dep_check_paa.md)**  
When you install a Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) file, you must verify that the file is compatible with the current version of HCL Digital Experience.
-   **[PAA dependencies for deployment and removal](add_paa_dependency.md)**  
The deployment and removal of a Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) file might depend on deployment of other PAA applications. You can specify the PAA dependencies for a PAA file in the assembly level sdd.xml file.
-   **[Create a Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) file](../developing_basic_paa_app/creating_paa_file/index.md)**  
Use the Portal Application Archive \(PAA\) file format to install applications with the Solution Installer. The PAA file is a customized compressed file that contains an application. This application is installed on HCL Digital Experience with the ConfigEngine.
