# Documentation directory

Place all documents and ID-related artifacts for the application in the documentation directory.

The PAA package developer must organize the documentation directory per the relationship between the documents and the flow of content information. The Solution Installer copies the content to the correct location in the expanded archive under the PAA offering directory; for example, [wp\_profile\_root](../../../../../guide_me/wpsdirstr.md)\\paa\\sample\_paa\\documentation\\\*.\*.

!!! note 
    The documentation directory is the only recommended place for documentation that is related to the application. There is no provision within the PAA format to provide documentation at the component level.
