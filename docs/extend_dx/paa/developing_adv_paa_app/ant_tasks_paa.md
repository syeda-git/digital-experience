# Tasks and extension points for custom code

You can use the following tasks and extension points when you create custom code to work with the ConfigEngine framework.

## Common Properties

These attributes are a reflection of similar attributes present on the WsAdmin task. Not all attributes on the WsAdmin task are used and some have a restricted range of values. None of these values are written into the dynamic profile.

|Attribute|Description|Required|Scope|
|---------|-----------|--------|-----|
|wasuser|Contains the user ID to authenticate with the server.|Yes|Global|
|waspassword|Contains the password that is associated with the wasuser user ID to authenticate with the server.|Yes|Global|
|conntype|Specifies the type of server connection. The following values are allowed:-   SOAP: Establishes a SOAP connection. This value is the default. <br>-   NONE: No server connection is used. Instead, a direct connection to the local WebSphereÂ® Application Server configuration repository is used.|No|Global|
|properties|Java properties file containing attributes to set in the JVM System properties. The default is ${EngineInstallLocation}/config/work/was/jacl.properties.|No|Global|
|script|Provides the location of the deployment script file. This file contains a set of commands to be passed to the WsAdmin script processor. Set the lang attribute to determine the script processor.If not specified, each deployment task assigns a default script location. It is built from the home directory of the configuration engine and a name specific to the task. For example, wplc_deployEar. Refer to the individual task for this name. Set the lang attribute to determine the file extension.|No|Global|
|lang|Contains the language to be used to interpret scripts. The supported values are as follows:-   jacl: Use the Jacl interpreter. This value is the default. <br>-   jpython: Use the Java Python interpreter.|No|Global|

## Framework-specific Attributes

These attributes provide information about the runtime environment that is associated with the configuration engine.

|Attribute|Description|Required|Scope|
|---------|-----------|--------|-----|
|engineinstalllocation|The location of the configuration engine home directory. This location is used as the root when you construct many of the default locations. It defaults to the setting of the Ant property: engineInstallLocation.|No|Global|
|engineinstalllocation|The location of a deployment file that contains some or all of the deployment attributes of the targeted resource. This file is an XML file whose syntax mirrors that of the Ant task that references the file.|No|not applicable|

## Embedded Markup Tag

The following markup tags are supported.

-   **Comment markup tag**

    Use the comment markup tag to embed a comment into a task value. The comment text is displayed during the task output trace, which is enclosed by parentheses. It is not included in the value that is passed to the task execution. Use <c\> or <comment\> to begin a comment. This tag has no attributes.

-   **Default markup tag**

    Use the default markup tag to force a default value for a task value. The default is chosen if the target value resolves to an empty string. Otherwise, it is ignored. Use <d\> or <default\> to delimit text that is defaulted. This tag has the following single attribute:

    -   value: The default value. This attribute is required.
-   **`<lower>` markup tag**

    Use the lower markup tag to force text to lowercase. Use `<l>` or `<lower>` to delimit lowercase text. This tag has no attributes.

-   **Password markup tag**

    Use the password markup tag to indicate a portion of text that is to remain hidden (or obscured) whenever the text value is logged. Use `<p>`, `<pw>`, or `<password>` to indicate the beginning of password text. This tag has no attributes. The default is to substitute the string, PASSWORD_REMOVED, for the text value during logging. You can override this value with the log attribute.

    -   log: The value that is substituted for the real password during logging of the task. Defaults to PASSWORD\_REMOVED. This attribute is not required.

-   **Upper markup tag**

    Use the upper markup tag to force text to uppercase. Use `<u>` or `<upper>` to delimit uppercase text. This tag has no attributes.

-   **Examples**

    The following example illustrates the use for each of the supported tags. The last instance embeds an undefined tag. This tag causes the parsing to stop and results in a value that is unchanged.

    ```
    <wplc-create-variable server="server"
          node="node"
          wasuser="${WasUserid}"
          waspassword="${WasPassword}"
          testbeanclass="com.ibm.wplc.deploy.tasks.impl.TestAdminBeanImpl">
          <resource name="r1" value="&lt;cValue for r1&lt;/>v1"/>       
    				<resource name="r2" value="&lt;dvalue=&quot;xxx&quot;> &lt;/>"/>     
    				<resource name="r3" value="<u>uPpEr</u>"/>       
    				<resource name="r4" value="<l>LoWeR</l>"/>       
    				<resource name="r5" value="<p>password</p>"/>       
    				<resource name="r6" value="<p log="SECRET">password</p>"/>       
    				<resource name="r7" value="<undefined attr="Attribute">password</undefined>"/>     
    </wplc-create-variable> 
    ```

    Running the previous task results in the following trace. The second set of output for each instance is produced by the test bean class. This bean class is a dummy bean implementation that is used to echo the output that is passed in to a bean for each WPLC task.

    -   earfile: The location of the EAR file to deploy.

-   **Optional parameters**

    -   classloadermode: Sets the class-loader delegation mode, also known as the class loader order. This value determines whether a class loader delegates the loading of classes to the parent class loader. The following values are supported:
        -   PARENT\_FIRST: Delegates the loading of classes to its parent before you load the class from its local path. This value is the default for the class-loader policy and for standard JVM class loaders.
        -   PARENT\_LAST: Causes the class loader to attempt to load classes from its local class path before you delegate the class loading to its parent. Using this policy, an application class loader can override and provide its own version of a class that exists in the parent class loader.
    -   startingweight: Sets the starting weight for the application. The starting weight specifies the order in which applications are started when the server starts. The application with the lowest starting weight is started first.
    -   server: The name of the application server for HCL Portal.
    -   node: The name of the WebSphereÂ® Application Server node.
    -   cell: The name of the WebSphereÂ® Application Server cell.

-   **Parameters that are specified as nested Elements**

    attribute - a generic attribute for this resource. Users can use this attribute to specify any additional name-value pairs that are not already covered by the wplc task. This parameter is used to pass any attribute that is associated with the resource action.

    -   name: The name of the attribute.
    -   value: The value of the attribute.
    option - Not all available EAR deployment options are supported by the wplc-create-ear syntax as attributes. The option element passes more information to the underlying framework inside the WsAdmin profile. This feature is similar to how other parameters are passed into the WsAdmin script file. However, in this situation, the full set of options are assembled into a string corresponding to the syntax of the scripting language.

    Do not code parameters that are included as attributes on the task as options. Use the corresponding attribute to avoid redundancy and to prevent runtime exception during the task parsing.

    The syntax of the nested option element allows for the following three formats: keyword only, keyword/value pairing, or keyword with value list.

    -   key: The name of the option
    -   value: The value of the option. If no value is present and the option does not contain nested value elements, then this key does not take a value.
    If a keyword can take a list of values, then a single nested value element is used for each value in the list.

    |Parameter type|Example (with AdminApp syntax)|Option element syntax|
    |--------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
    |Keyword only|`-nodeployejb`|`<option key="nodeployejb"/>`|
    |Keyword with simple value|`-custom value`|`<option key="custom" value="value"/>`|
    |Keyword with list of values|`-MapresrefToEJB {{value1} {value2} {value3}}`|  `<option key="MapResRefToEJB"/>` <br>`	<value>value1</value> `<br>`	<value>value2</value>` <br>`	<value>value3</value> `<br>`</option>`|
