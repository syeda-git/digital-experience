# Staging and migration

For staging or migration purposes, you can use the portal XML configuration interface \(XMLAccess\) to transfer HCL UX Screen Flow Manager related data from one system to another.

To transfer the data, run a full XMLAccess export of all dialogs that you want to transfer. Then, do an import of the exported data. For more information, go to *Deploy dialog sets by using the XML configuration interface*.
