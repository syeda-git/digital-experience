# Advanced concepts

Learn about the advanced concepts of the HCL UX Screen Flow Manager.

-   **[Retrieve and store event payload](../advance_concepts/retrieve_store_event_payload/index.md)**  
In a normal portal environment, the portlets in a single dialog can exchange data through a set of well-defined events. However, you might want to include third-party portlets or older portlets that are not aligned with the normal portal environment. You can include such portlets with the HCL UX Screen Flow Manager.
-   **[Access control](access_cntrl.md)**  
You can use the Portal Access Control (PAC) to control what users can do when they are working with dialogs.
-   **[Scoping session data and render parameters](scpng_sesn_dt_rndr_prmts.md)**  
The appearance of portlets heavily relies on the portlet session data and the render parameters. To better support the semi-parallel processing of dialogs, the portlet session data and the render parameters are stored in a scoped fashion.
-   **[Dynamic pages and portlets](dyn_pgs_ptlts.md)**  
The HCL UX Screen Flow Manager not only supports redirecting users between static portal resources, but also between dynamic resources. The HCL Portal feature Dynamic UI Management is used.
