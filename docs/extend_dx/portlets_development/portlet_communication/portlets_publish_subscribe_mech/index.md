# Standard portlets publish and subscribe mechanisms

Both JSR 168 and 286 portlets provide communication capabilities that enable you to pass information from one portlet to another. For JSR 286 portlets, these capabilities are included in the JSR 286 standard. For JSR 168 portlets, an extension defined by HCL provides these capabilities. Portlet developers define these capabilities. Portal administrators then determine whether or not these capabilities are used to pass information between portlets.

-   **[Define portlet communication capabilities](define_portlet_comm_capabilities/index.md)**  
Standard portlets provide powerful publish and subscribe mechanisms for exchanging information by using an action such as semantic invocation. These mechanisms can be used to exchange complex data between portlets and to trigger portlet activity such as updates to back-end systems.
-   **[Triggering communication](trigerring_communication/index.md)**  
These communication methods are based on directed communication links that pass information from a source portlet to a target portlet.
