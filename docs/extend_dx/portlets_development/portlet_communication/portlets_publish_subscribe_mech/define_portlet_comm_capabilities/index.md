# Define portlet communication capabilities

Standard portlets provide powerful publish and subscribe mechanisms for exchanging information by using an action such as semantic invocation. These mechanisms can be used to exchange complex data between portlets and to trigger portlet activity such as updates to back-end systems.

-   **[JSR 286 portlet events based communications](pltcom_events.md)**  
Portlet events provide a powerful and flexible publish/subscribe mechanism for communication between JSR 286 portlets. They can be used to exchange complex data between portlets and to trigger portlet activity such as updates to back end systems. In the portal, they can also interoperate with other communication mechanisms such as Cooperative portlets and click-to-action.
-   **[JSR 168 HCL extension for cooperative portlets](jsr168_hcl_ext_coop_portlets/index.md)**  
Cooperative portlets represent an HCL Portal-specific API for publish/subscribe communication between portlets.
-   **[Interoperability between JSR 286 portlet events and JSR 168 cooperative portlets](pltcom_interop.md)**  
By concept, cooperative portlets are similar to JSR 286 portlet events. Both concepts describe publish/subscribe communication patterns that are based on typed information that is published and received by portlets and propagated via communication links.
