# Special purpose techniques for data exchange

HCL Digital Experience supports special purpose techniques for data exchange.

-   **Cookies**

    The Java Portlet Specification 2.0 adds support for portlets to read and set HTTP cookies. You can share cookies between portlets and other Web applications to track information about the current browser interaction without requiring a server side session and without consuming server resources.

-   **Custom JavaScript data exchange**

    As portlets are Web components inside an HTML page, you can use any client side techniques to read, write or exchange data within the markup that your portlet provides. This includes sharing data via the page document object model \(DOM\) or use of client side JavaScript code or libraries.
