# Copying portlets

Use Manage Portlets to copy a portlet. If a portlet is copied or a remote portlet is integrated, a new portlet application is created by the portal that holds the new portlet.

When you copy a portlet, give the copy a new name. When you copy the portlet, the portlet data is copied, but the copied portlet uses the same resources as the original portlet. When a copied portlet is copied, the new portlet also uses the same resources as the original portlet. An example of portlet data is the portlet configuration parameters needed for a particular instance of a portlet An example of a portlet resource is an image that the portlet displays in the user interface. While the portlet configuration parameter is associated with each individual instance of the portlet, all instances of the portlet use the same image.
