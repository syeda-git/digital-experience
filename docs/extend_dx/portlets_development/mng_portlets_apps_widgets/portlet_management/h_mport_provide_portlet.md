title: Providing a portlet through WSRP
---




As a WSRP Producer, you can provide portlets through WSRP to Consumers. Consumers can then integrate these portlets into their portal remotely and use them.

To provide a portlet to Consumer portals, proceed as follows:

1.  In the list of portlets, locate the portlet that you want to provide.

2.  Click the **Provide portlet** icon in the row for the portlet that you want to provide.

    A prompt opens for you to confirm the Provide action.

3.  Click **OK** at the prompt to provide the portlet, or click **Cancel** to quit.

    If you click **OK**, a check mark is shown in the **Provided** column for the portlet, and the **Provide portlet** icon for the portlet changes to the **Withdraw portlet** icon.


The portlet is provided through WSRP. It can now be consumed as a remote portlet by Consumer portals.

**Note:** Only settings that are made in the Configure mode of the portlet on the Producer portal are available at the consumed remote portlet. Adding a remote portlet to a page on the Consumer side might create a new instance of the provided portlet on the Producer side. This portlet instance can be modified only on the Consumer portal. It is not available for use on the Producer portal.
