title: Deleting a portlet application
---




Delete a portlet application from the portal. If you delete a portlet application, then the corresponding portlet applications and portlets are also deleted. You cannot perform this task on JSR standard portlet applications because each JSR portlet Web module can only contain a single portlet application.

Perform the following steps to delete a portlet application:

1.  Select **Delete** from the appropriate row.

2.  Click **OK** at the prompt to continue, or click **Cancel** to quit.


A message displays stating that the deletion was successful.
