Add or delete a parameter/value pair, or set locale-specific titles and descriptions for an HCL API portlet application. You cannot perform these tasks on JSR standard portlet applications because the Java Portlet Specification does not have the concept of parameters or locale-specific titles on an application level.

Perform the following steps to modify portlet application parameters:

1.  Click **Edit** from the appropriate row for the portlet application.

2.  To add a parameter/value pair:

    1.  Enter the parameter in the **New parameter** field.

    2.  Enter the value of the parameter in the **New value** field.

    3.  Click the **Add** button.

3.  To delete a parameter/value pair:

    1.  Select **Delete** from the appropriate row.

    2.  Select **OK** at the prompt to continue the delete, or select **Cancel** to quit.

4.  To set locale-specific titles and descriptions:

    1.  Select the **I want to set titles and descriptions** link.

    2.  Select **Edit** from the appropriate row for the locale.

    3.  Enter a new title in the **New title:** field.

    4.  Enter a description in the **New description** field.

    5.  Click **OK** to continue or **Cancel** to quit.

5.  Click **OK** to continue and return to the parameter/value pair for the portlet application or **Cancel** to quit.

6.  Click **OK** to continue and return to the list of portlet applications or **Cancel** to quit.
