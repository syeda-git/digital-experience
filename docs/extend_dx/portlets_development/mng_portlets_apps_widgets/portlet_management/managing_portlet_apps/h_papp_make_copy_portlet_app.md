title: Making a copy of a portlet application
---




Make a copy of an existing HCL Digital Experience API portlet application. You cannot perform this task on JSR standard portlet applications because each JSR portlet Web module can only contain a single portlet application. Note that you can create multiple copies of a JSR portlet inside that single application.

Perform the following steps to make a copy of a portlet application.

1.  Click **Copy** from the appropriate row.

2.  Enter a new name for the portlet application copy or use the default copy name.

3.  Click **OK** to continue or **Cancel** to quit.

    If you click OK, a confirmation message displays stating that the copy was successful.


The new portlet application contains a copy of each portlet that was in the original application. Initially, these portlets have the same titles as the portlets from which they were copied. You can select the copied portlet application, view the contained portlets by clicking on the title of the portlet application, and assign new titles, so that administrators can distinguish the copied portlets from the originals.
