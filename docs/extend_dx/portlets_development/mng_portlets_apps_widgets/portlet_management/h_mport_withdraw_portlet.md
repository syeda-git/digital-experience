title: Withdrawing a portlet
---




You can withdraw portlets from being provided and being available through WSRP. Consumer portals can then no longer use them.

To withdraw a portlet from use by Consumer portals, proceed as follows:

1.  In the list of portlets, locate the portlet that you want to withdraw.

2.  Click the **Withdraw portlet** icon in the row for the portlet that you want to withdraw.

    A prompt opens for you to confirm the Withdraw action.

3.  Click **OK** at the prompt to withdraw the portlet, or click **Cancel** to quit.

    If you click **OK**, the check mark disappears from the **Provided** column for the portlet, and the **Withdraw portlet** icon for the portlet changes to the **Provide portlet** icon.


The portlet is withdrawn. It is no longer available for Consumer portals to consume.
