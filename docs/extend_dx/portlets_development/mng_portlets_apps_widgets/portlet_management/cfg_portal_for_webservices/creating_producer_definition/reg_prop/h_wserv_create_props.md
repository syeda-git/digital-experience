On the Consumer portal, you can create registration properties for a web service Producer.

Creating a registration property is optional and only for Producers that require registration by the Consumer.

1.  Click the advanced option **I want to enter registration properties for this Producer** in the New Producer or Edit Producer panel.

    Web Service Configuration displays the Set Registration Properties panel with input fields for you to type the parameter name and the value of the new property.

2.  Type the name and value for the new property in the respective input fields.

3.  Click **Add** to create the property.

    The Web Service Configuration lists the new property in the list.

4.  Click **OK** to save the new property you created, or click **Cancel** if you do not want to save the new property and return to the previous panel.
