You can delete a Producer definition from your portal.

To delete a Producer definition from your portal, proceed as follows:

1.  Click **Delete** for that Producer definition in the list of Producers.

    The Web Services Configuration portlet prompts you to confirm the deletion. It also displays a list with all the portlets that you currently consume from this Producer and that are available to users of your portal. If you delete the Producer definition, then all portlets that your Consumer portal consumes from this Producer are also deleted from your portal.

2.  Click **OK** to confirm deleting the Producer definition, or click **Cancel** to keep the Producer definition in your portal.

    Web Service Configuration returns to the main panel.
