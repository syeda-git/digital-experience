You use the Resource Permissions portlet to assign access to a Web module.

Follow these steps to assign permissions to a Web module.

1.  Select **Assign access** from the appropriate row.

2.  Click **Help** to get details on using the Resource Permissions portlet.


**Note:** Access permissions on a Web module control only which users can administer the Web module. They do not allow users to view portlets on a page. You control access to portlets on pages only by giving permissions on portlet applications and portlets.
