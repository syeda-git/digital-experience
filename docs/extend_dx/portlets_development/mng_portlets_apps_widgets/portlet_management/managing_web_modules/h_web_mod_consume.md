title: Consuming a remote portlet
---




You can select to consume remote portlets. To do so, you use the **Manage Web Modules** portlet.

To consume a remote portlet, perform the following steps:

1.  Click **Consume**.

    The list of Producers is displayed.

2.  Select a Producer. You can search to locate a particular Producer.

    When you select the Producer, the list of portlets that are provided by that Producer is displayed.

3.  Select a portlet that you want consume as a remote portlet. You can search to locate a particular portlet.

4.  Click **OK** to continue, or **Cancel** to quit.


**Note:** When a Producer provides a portlet, only settings that are made in the Configure mode of the portlet are available for the consumed remote portlet. Adding a remote portlet to a page on the Consumer side creates a new instance of the provided portlet on the Producer side. But this portlet instance can be modified only on the Consumer. It is not visible on the Producer portal.
