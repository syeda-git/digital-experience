# Application extension registry

HCL Digital Experience provides an application extension registry which is equivalent to the application extension registry provided by IBM WebSphere Application Server. This registry allows any J2EE compliant application to define extension points for other applications to use, or to plug in to other extensible applications.

The application extension registry uses the Eclipse plug-in descriptor format and APIs as the standard extensibility mechanism for WebSphere applications. For more information about the application extension registry, see *Application extension registry* in the *IBM® WebSphere® Application Server Help Center* and *Notes on the Eclipse Plug-in Architecture*.
