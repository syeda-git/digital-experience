# Detailed descriptions of the Struts WML tags

Learn about the WML tags used by the portlets within the Struts Application Framework.

The following tags are used by portlets within the Struts Application Framework. For a brief description of WML support in the Struts Application Framework, see [Using the WML tags](https://help.hcltechsw.com/digital-experience/9.5/dev-portlet/wpstrjsps.html#wpstrjsps__wml).

-   **<wml:cancel/\>**

    Renders a WML <postfield\> element with a value of `cancel`. This tag is only valid when nested inside a form tag body. Posting this element causes the `Action` servlet to bypass calling the associated form bean validate\(\) method.

    |Attribute name|Description|
    |--------------|-----------|
    |property|The parameter name with the specified value that is set in the request object.<br> **Note:** If the property attribute is set, then the application will have to handle cancel detection.

\[Runtime expression\]

|
    |value|The value of the request parameter. \[Runtime expression\]

|

-   **<wml:card/\>**

    This tag renders a card element. This element is not rendered when the tag is executed in HCL Portal. This allows writing JSPs that can be used in both the servlet and portlet environments.

    |Attribute name|Description|
    |--------------|-----------|
    |id|This attribute is the card unique identifier. \[Runtime expression\]

|
    |newcontext|This is a flag to indicate that context should be reinitialized when loaded. \[Runtime expression\]

|
    |titleKey|Key to look up title in resource bundle, titleKey is only used if title attribute is null. \[Runtime expression\]

|

-   **<wml:errors/\>**

    Retrieves the set of error messages from the request object with the default key of `Action.ERROR_KEY` or the value specified by attribute name. If `ActionErrors` are found then the errors are displayed. This tag also requires the following two message keys in the application scope MessageResources.

    -   `errors.header` - header that is displayed before the error messages list.
    -   `errors.footer` - header that is displayed after the error messages list.
    |Attribute name|Description|
