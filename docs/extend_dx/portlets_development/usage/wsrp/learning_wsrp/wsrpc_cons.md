# WSRP Consumer

WSRP Consumers consume the portlets that Producers provide.

A WSRP Consumer is a portal that calls WSRP services on Producer portals and consumes portlets from Producer portals that provide them as remote portlets.

The Consumer part of the WSRP implementation in the portal enables the portal to consume portlets by calling WSRP services from remote Producer portals. The Consumer works as the "client" of the WSRP communication.

A WSRP Consumer integrates selected portlets into the Consumer portal as remote portlets. The Consumer portal requests and receives the markup from the remote WSRP service at the Producer portal and presents it to its users. This way, the Consumer portal can consume one or more remote portlets through the WSRP services.
