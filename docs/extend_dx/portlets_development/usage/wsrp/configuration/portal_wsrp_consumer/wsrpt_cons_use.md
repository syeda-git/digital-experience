# Using your portal as a WSRP Consumer

Learn about the tasks that you perform when you use your portal as a WSRP Consumer portal to consume remote portlets. You can consume portlets from a HCL Digital Experience or from a different WSRP Producer such as the IBM WSRP Version 2.0 Producer for IBM WebSphere Application Server.

1.  [Information that the Consumer exchanges with the Producer](../../portal_wsrp_producer/wsrp_producer_info/index.md)  
Before a Consumer can consume portlets from a Producer, the Consumer needs specific information about the Producer. Depending on your configuration, you might also need to provide information about your Consumer portal to the Producer.
2.  [Working with Producer definitions](../../portal_wsrp_consumer/working_with_producer_def/index.md)  
To make a WSRP Producer known to your Consumer portal, you create a Producer definition for that WSRP Producer in your Consumer portal. You can also configure the Producer definition.
3.  [Consuming portlets in a Consumer portal](../../portal_wsrp_consumer/consuming_portlets_consumer_portal/index.md)  
After you create a Producer definition, you can proceed to consume the portlets that are provided by that Producer. This way, you integrate them into your Consumer portal as remote portlets.
4.  [Customizing the WSRP configuration of your Consumer portal](../../portal_wsrp_consumer/customizing_wsrp_cfg_consumer_portal/index.md)  
You can customize some aspects of you WSRP Consumer portal.
