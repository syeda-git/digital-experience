Set language-specific titles and descriptions for a web service Producer definition.

To set language-specific titles and descriptions for a web service Producer definition, proceed as follows:

1.  Click the **Edit** icon for the Producer definition that you want to modify.

    The Web Service Configuration portlet displays the Edit Producer panel.

2.  Click the advanced option **I want to set titles and descriptions for other languages** in the Edit Producer panel.

    The Web Service Configuration portlet displays a table that lists all languages that are available in your portal.

3.  To change the title and description for a language, click **Edit** for that language.

    The Web Service Configuration portlet displays a panel with four fields, one each for the current and the new titles and descriptions:

    -   Current title
    -   Current description
    -   New title
    -   New description.
    
    Both the **Current** fields are blocked. Both the **New** fields are input fields. Initially both the current and the new fields show the existing information.

4.  Type over the information in the input fields for the **New** title and description as required.

    The fields for the Current title and description continue to show the existing information for your reference.

5.  After you update the information, click **OK** to save your data and return to the list of languages. If you want to return without saving your data, click **Cancel**.
