title: Configuring the Web Service Configuration portlet
---




Specify the maximum number of Producer definitions that you want to view in the table, the maximum number of Producers you want to view on each page, and the user attributes that you want to be passed to Producers by default.

Depending on your access rights, you can configure or edit some standard features. Both the Configure and the Edit Shared Settings modes offer you the same options, but with different consequences:

-   **Configuring** means that you set the defaults of how the standard features of the portlet are displayed for **all** users. The portal applies these default settings to all instances and for all users of the portlet. To configure the portlet, select the **Configure** option from the header bar of the portlet. The Configuration mode is displayed. You can also configure portlets by using the Manage Portlets portlet under Administration.
-   **Editing the shared settings** means that you customize how the standard features of the portlet are displayed. The portal applies these settings only to the instance of the portlet that the user edits. To edit the portlet, select the **Edit shared settings** option from the header bar of the portlet. The Edit mode is displayed.

The configuration and edit options are shown in the following list:

-   ****Never show more than this number of items****

    This field is an input field. Use this field to specify the maximum number of Producers that you want to be listed in the table.

-   ****Number of items per page****

    This field is an input field. Use this field to specify the maximum number of Producers you want to be listed on each page.

-   **Default URL to WSDL service definitions**

    This field is an input field. Use this field to specify the default URL to the WSDL service definition in the New Producer panel.

-   ****These user attributes should be the defaults passed to Producers****

    This table lists user attributes with check boxes. Mark the check boxes for those user attributes that you want to be passed to Producers by default.


To configure or edit your portlet, proceed as follows:

1.  Hover your mouse over the portlet title bar and view the downward arrow.

2.  Click the downward arrow to open the portlet menu with portlet mode selection options.

3.  Select the appropriate option from the menu, depending on the available options and the task that you want to perform. If you want to change how the portlet is shown to all users, click **Configure**. If you want to changes to an instance of the portlet for all users, click **Edit Shared Settings**. If you want to make individual changes to the portlet, click **Personalize**. The panel for configuring, editing, or personalizing the portlet settings is displayed. For more information about the menu options, see the portal Information Center and search for **portlet mode**.

4.  Enter the data and make the selections as required.

5.  Click **OK** to save your configuration updates, or click **Cancel** if you do not want to save the updated configuration. The Web Service Configuration portlet returns to the main panel. You can also return by selecting **Back** from the portlet menu.
