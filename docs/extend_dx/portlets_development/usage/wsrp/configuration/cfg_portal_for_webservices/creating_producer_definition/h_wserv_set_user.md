title: Setting user attributes to be passed to a web service Producer
---




You can set user attributes that you want to be passed on to the web service Producer. The values for the selected attributes are passed on to the Producer when your portal users use the Producer's portlet. For example, if you select the attribute for user name, the user's name is passed on to the Producer. As a result, the Producer's portlet can address your portal users by their names. Setting user attributes is optional.

1.  In the New Producer or Edit Producer panel, click the advanced option **I want to specify the user attributes that should be passed on to this Producer**.

    The Web Service Configuration portlet displays the Set User Attributes panel. It shows a table that lists the available user attributes.

2.  Click the check boxes to select the user attributes that you want to be passed on to the Producer.

3.  Click **OK** to save your selection, or click **Cancel** if you do not want to save your selection.

    The Web Service Configuration portlet returns to the previous panel.


You can configure user attributes that are passed on to Producers by default by using the Configure option from the portlet menu.
