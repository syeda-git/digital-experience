# Web Developer Toolkit for HCL Digital Experience

Learn more about what you can do with the Web Developer Toolkit for HCL Digital Experience.

The Web Developer toolkit for HCL Digital Experience provides the ability to sync themes, content and script portlets (also known as Script Applications). It is available under the Apache License V2.0.

This toolkit includes two main areas of functionality:

-   A **Web Developer Dashboard** that provides a user interface for working with Script Portlets, HCL Digital Experience themes, and Web Content Manager design elements. The theme support uses the [Digital Experience File Sync](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/dxsync) tool under the covers. The Script Portlet support uses the Script Portlet command line support which must be installed separately on your workstation.
-   A command line tool "(`dxwcmdesigns`") for moving Web Content Manager design elements - Presentation Templates and Components - between your local file system and your HCL Portal server. This functionality is also available from the Dashboard.
