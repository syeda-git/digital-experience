# Customizing the WSRP resource proxy

The WSRP resource proxy is used by the WSRP Consumer to load resources that are referenced by remote portlets.

Depending on your environment, it can be necessary to customize the resource proxy behavior with regards to the following aspects:

-   SSL settings for secure connections to remote resources
-   LTPA token forwarding for single sign-on scenarios
-   Proxy server settings for outbound connections
-   Support for relative URLs
-   HTTP basic authentication for outbound connections
-   HTTP headers that are not forwarded.
