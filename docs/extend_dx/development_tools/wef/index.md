# Web Experience Factory (WEF)
## Web Experience Factory Designer - Overview

[HCL Web Experience Factory (WEF)](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_search&spa=1&language=en,ja&query=web%20experience%20factory) creates applications with rich, interactive digital experiences for delivery on desktop browsers, smartphones, tablets, and other channels. This application development tool enables developers to build custom web portlets, widgets, and applications for [HCL Digital Experience](https://www.hcltechsw.com/dx/features), and IBM WebSphere Application Server environments.

## Using HCL Web Experience Factory 8.5.1

Along with the release of HCL Digital Experience CF205, HCL has released an updated version of HCL Web Experience Factory, which is version 8.5.1. This release includes support for Java 1.8 and Eclipse 4.2.2 as outlined below.

## Updates from HCL Web Experience Factory 8.5 to HCL Web Experience Factory v8.5.1

1. Previous releases of IBM Web Experience Factory and HCL Web Experience Factory v8.5 were available with an Installer package. The HCL Web Experience Factory 8.5.1 is available as a zip file which contains the Web Experience Factory 8.5.1 (WEF) plugin pre-installed in Eclipse version 4.4.

2. Previous releases of Web Experience Factory compiled the applications with Java 1.6/1.7 SDKs. HCL Web Experience Factory 8.5.1 is compiled using a Java 1.8 SDK.

3. Previous releases of Web Experience Factory contained a default IBM WebSphere Liberty Version 6 server and IBM JDK 6. HCL Web Experience Factory 8.5.1 does not contain a default application server or JDK. HCL Web Experience Factory 8.5.1 is compatible with any Version 8 JDK or Java server to deploy applications locally. **It is compatible with HCL DX 8.5, 9.0 and 9.5 (CF205 or later) running servers.**

4. HCL Web Experience Factory 8.5.1 is pre-installed in an Eclipse IDE. Use of the IBM Rational Application Developer IDE is not supported with this HCL WEF 8.5.1 release.

5. **Upgrading to HCL Web Experience Factory v8.5.1**: We recommend developers install HCL Web Experience Factory v8.5.1 as a fresh installation and migrate existing portlets developed using previous releases of Web Experience Factory following the steps below.

## Migrate portlets from IBM Web Experience Factory to HCL Web Experience Factory

To work with portlets created with Web Experience Factory releases prior to V8.5.1 in your workspace:

1. Create a backup of your existing WEF applications workspace.

2. Open the eclipse using executable file under the eclipse folder in respective platforms.

3. Enter the existing workspace path. It displays throw an alert message:

    ```
    "Workspace '<old-workspace-path>' was written with an older version of the product and will be updated. Updating the workspace can make it incompatiable with older versions of the product. Are you sure you want to continue with this workspace?"
    ```

  The alert message is displayed because the Eclipse version is upgraded during the HCL Web Experience Factory 8.5.1 installation. It does not corrupt your workspace. Click OK to continue. This opens all the applications in the latest WEF v8.5.1 perspective but with errors thrown for the project version.

4. Go to **Window > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs**.

5. Add the JRE 8 path and check it to default if it does not exist, otherwise verify JRE path you have defined is accurate.

6. Right-click on each project and select **Upgrade project Version**.

7. If you have set up IBM WebSphere Liberty v6 in the previous workspace, do note that it will also be migrated and it will run as if it runs on its own JRE 6. You may upgrade it to JRE 8 or delete it.

    !!!note
        To publish the WEF 8.5.1 project from the WEF 8.5.1 Designer directly into a target Digital Experience (DX) Server, the JRE used for running the Designer should be updated with the target DX Server SSL certificates. Please refer to the steps below.

## Import the SSL Certificate into the Java keystore

1. Navigate to `Installed-JRE-path'/lib/security` from the workstation terminal or via command prompt.

2. Execute the keytool to import the certificates into the Java keystore of the current JRE that runs the HCL WEF v8.5.1 Designer (The keytool is pre-installed with Java. If unavailable, install it separately).

    -   For Windows platforms:

        ```
        keytool.exe -import -trustcacerts -alias <alias-name> -file <path-to-the-certificate-file> -keystore <keystore> -storepass <password>
        ```

        Example:
        ```
        keytool.exe -import -trustcacerts -alias default -file C:\Downloads\mylocal.der -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit
        ```

    -   For Linux platforms:

        ```
        keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias <alias-name> -file <path-to-the-certificate-file> -keystore <keystore> -storepass <password>
        ```

        Example:
        ```
        keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias default -file /home/centos/Downloads/mylocal.der -keystore cacerts -storepass changeit
        ```

3. A success message displays after the certificates are imported into the Java keystore.

## Deploy a portlet into target HCL DX servers

There are three options to deploy a portlet into a target HCL DX server.
