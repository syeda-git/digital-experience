# Virtual portals and managed pages

Virtual portals are created and managed through the portal administration interface with the Virtual Portal Manager portlet. When you create a virtual portal, a workspace is created that contains a new Portal Site web content library. Any managed pages that are created in the virtual portal are stored in the Portal Site library.

Because web content libraries are not shared across virtual portals, these pages are visible only within the virtual portal.

Syndication of the Portal Site library for a virtual portal is the same as syndication of any other web content library.
