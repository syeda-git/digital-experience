# Preconfiguring virtual portals

When you use the Virtual Portal Manager portlet to create a virtual portal, the portlet creates the new virtual portal with default portal content and resources. It also creates default access rights for the virtual portal sub-administrators on those resources. You can modify both the default portal content and the default access rights for the sub-administrators globally and before creating a virtual portal.


-   **[Preconfiguring the default content for virtual portals](advp_precfg_content.md)**  
When you create the virtual portal by using the Virtual Portal Manager portlet, the virtual portal is pre-filled with default content. This default content is determined by the default XML script file for initializing virtual portals.
-   **[Preconfiguring the sub-administrators for virtual portals](advp_precfg_subadm.md)**  
You can configure the roles and access rights that are assigned to sub-administrators on portlets of a virtual portal globally and before you create a virtual portal. The following steps must be completed on your initial portal installation. -->
