# Creating dynamic content spots

There are two ways you can create dynamic content spots. You can use a module, or a resource environment provider.

<!--
-   **[Creating a dynamic content spot with a module](../rwd/rwd_define_mod_override.md)**  
In most situations, use the modularized approach to define dynamic content spots. This approach is more flexible than defining them through Resource Environment Providers. You can also switch the dynamic content spot per page and override existing content spot when you define them with a module.

You can create a custom dynamic content spot to include in a theme template.
