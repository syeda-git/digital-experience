# Working with dynamic content spots

You can add dynamic content to your custom theme by using either client-side or server-side logic.

You can add dynamic content to your custom theme's static content by using dynamic content spots. Dynamic content spots are hook points in your static markup such as the theme.html that delegates somewhere else to inject more markup at that spot the page. It can be delegated to any URI known to the system. For instance, it can point to a server-side component such as JSP or servlet.

To abstract the theme from direct links into server-side code, use the dyn-cs: schema with a unique identifier for a dynamic content spot. This allows for advanced features such as delegating to different JSPs on different pages. Use the following examples.

Including a named dynamic content spot mapping:

```
<a rel="dynamic-content" href="dyn-cs:id:newDynamicContentSpotName"></a>
```

Including a theme JSP directly:

```
<a rel="dynamic-content" 
   href="res:/CustomThemeContext/themes/html/MyTheme/dynamicContent.jsp"></a>
```

## Configuring and modifying named dynamic content spots

The dynamic content spot mappings can be defined as part of the module definition by using the `ref-id` attribute on a `dyn-cs` contribution type. Or, they can be defined for the theme and skin templates in a Resource Environment Provider \(REP\) named WP DynamicContentSpotMappings in the WebSphere® Integrated Solutions Console. For more information, see *Creating a dynamic content spot*.

The following tables are an overview of the dynamic content spots that are most frequently used. Use the Theme Analyzer's Contribution Explorer to see all the dynamic content spots provided.

You can modify the dynamic content spot values two different ways.

-   Dynamic content spots that are defined through module `wp_dynamicContentSpots_85` are part of the default theme and is cloned when you create your own theme. Rename the module in your theme, update the reference in the profile, and then you can change the values of the dynamic content spots.
-   System dynamic content spots such as `wp_search_dynspot` can be changed by overriding dynamic content spots with the module framework. For example, you can create a module that redefines this dynamic content spot that requires the core module `wp_search`. Your dynamic content spot reference is used as a result.

-   **[Creating dynamic content spots](../dev-theme/themeopt_cust_creat_dyn_con_spot_parent.md)**  
There are two ways you can create dynamic content spots. You can use a module, or a resource environment provider.
-   **[Conditionally disable dynamic content spots](../dev-theme/themeopt_cust_dcsmarkupcontrol.md)**  
You can control whether a dynamic content spot is rendered into the page or not based on the fact whether a certain module exists on the page or not.
-   **[Modules and dynamic content spots](../dev-theme/themeopt_modules_dyn_cnt_spts.md)**  
You can use the modularized framework for dynamic content spots to override spots that were defined through resource environment providers.
-   **[Dynamic content spot debugging](../dev-theme/themeopt_dyn_cnt_spt_debugging.md)**  
Dynamic Content Spots add dynamic markup into static themes or skins. Sometimes, it is difficult to discern which parts of the page were contributed from which dynamic content spots.
