# Making your custom skin the default skin

Add your custom skin to the skins list to set it as the default skin for your theme. If it is the only custom skin, it is automatically set as the default skin for your theme.

**Important:** If you did not enable development mode before you copied your theme, restart your portal server before you complete the following steps.

1.  Log on to HCL Digital Experience.

2.  Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal User Interface** \> **Themes and Skins**.

3.  Select **Custom Theme** in the themes list and click **Edit theme**.

4.  Select **Custom Skin** in **Skins for this theme** list and click **Set as Default**.

5.  Click **OK**.


Your theme is now available for use on your portal. To verify, create a page, edit page properties, and assign your theme to the page.

!!! note
    Your custom theme uses ready-use modules, which are shared across themes and intentionally remain uncopied in the Theme Modules web application. For your theme to operate the Theme Modules web application must remain started in addition to the web application for your theme.
