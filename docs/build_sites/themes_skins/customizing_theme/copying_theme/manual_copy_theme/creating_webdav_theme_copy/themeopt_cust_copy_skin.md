# Copying the static resources for your skin

You need to make a unique copy of the static resources for your skin.

1.  Connect your WebDAV client to http://host:port/wps/mycontenthandler/dav/skinlist/.

2.  Copy the ibm.portal.85Hidden folder to a local disk.

3.  Rename the folder to the name of your skin, such as customSkin.

4.  In the metadata folder, edit the localized\_en.properties file, or whichever file is your default locale, and change the value of the title key to the display name of your skin, such as Custom Skin. Save the file. Repeat this step for any of the other locale files for the languages that you support.

5.  Save your files on your local disk.
