# Drag-and-drop

Drag-and-drop uses HTML5 code to facilitate the layout of content.

Drag sources and drop targets do not need any JavaScript library. Some convenience functions are provided in the i$.dnd API. For example, with drag-and-drop, you can drag an item, such as a portlet or content item from the toolbar on the page. Or you can drag an item from one position on the page to another position.

-   **[Customizing drop targets on the page](../dev-theme/themeopt_cust_dndcofig.md)**  
In edit mode, portal renders drop targets for all positions where a portlet can be added to the page. In the default theme, these drop targets are hidden unless an item is dragged over the surrounding container.
-   **[Custom drag sources and drop targets](../dev-theme/themeopt_cust_dndcreate.md)**  
Drag sources and drop targets must be created according to the HTML 5 specification. In HTML 5, the DataTransfer object is used to exchange data from source to target. -->
