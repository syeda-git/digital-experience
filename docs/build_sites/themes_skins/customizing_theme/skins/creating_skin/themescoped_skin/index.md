# Create a theme-scoped skin

You can create a custom skin that is scoped to a specific theme when you copy an existing ready-use choice to use as the base for your new skin.

You can define new skin resources manually or by using the Manage properties portlet. After the skin is assigned to the theme, you can define the skin and apply it to specific portlets or use it as the theme default.
