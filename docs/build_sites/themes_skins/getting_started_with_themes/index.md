# Getting started with Themes

Before you begin to develop themes, learn about the resources and the tools you can leverage to create and customize them.


-   **[Theme components and resources](themeopt_themedev_creation_and_resources.md)**  
You can quickly create a new theme based on an existing template when you use the Theme Development Tools. The Simple Theme and the Portal 8.5 Theme are available for immediate use.
-   **[Granting access to theme development tools](themeopt_themedev_tools_access.md)**  
By default, theme development tools are available to the administrator only. You can grant access for managing themes to other users and user groups, such as a theme design team.
-   **[Theme Manager](themeopt_themedev_manager.md)**  
Use the Theme Manager portlet to create new themes from templates, edit existing themes, and copy, export, or delete themes with one click.
-   **[Manage Theme Properties](themeopt_themedev_etp.md)**  
You can modify the properties of a theme and its available skins in the Manage Theme Properties dialog. In the dialog, you can modify the properties of both WAR-based and WebDAV-based themes, but not all modification options are available for WAR-based themes.
-   **[Creating a theme](themeopt_themedev_create.md)**  
You can quickly create a new theme that is based on a template when you click the Create Theme icon.
