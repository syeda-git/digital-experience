# EJPNO1006I error

Unnecessary module found within profile.

## Explanation

A module has been found in the profile even though it is already part of the dependency tree of your profile. As there is no guarantee in the order of modules within the profile list, it is recommended to define dependencies only through module dependencies.

## User action

Remove the listed module from the profile unless there is a reason to keep it.
