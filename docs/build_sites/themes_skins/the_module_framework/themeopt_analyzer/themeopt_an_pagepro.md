In the tree view, when a page has a specified profile that is not inherited from the parent, the profile name displays in parentheses after the page name.

The details view displays details for the selected page as well as the theme and profile that are used on the page. If a theme or profile is inherited, it is displayed in parentheses after the theme or profile name. When a theme or profile is set specifically, no comment is displayed.

When you expand a tree or branch, if it is large and takes more than 30 seconds to expand, the expansion process is stopped. You must expand those branches individually.

The page explorer provides specialized view of your website pages to shows theme information. It is not intended to provide general information about pages.
