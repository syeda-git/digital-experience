# Dynamic content \(jsp\) resources

Dynamic content includes resources that are defined by jsp files that are used by the theme.

The entry point for a theme is either Default.jsp or Plain.jsp, both of these files are located here:

[PortalServer\_root](../../../guide_me/wpsdirstr.md)\\theme\\wp.theme.themes\\default85\\installedApps\\DefaultTheme85.ear\\DefaultTheme85.war\\themes\\html

-   Default.jsp: Is a main entry point for the theme and bootstraps any required infrastructure, and then delegates all markup rendering to the static template file, which is usually theme.html.
-   Plain.jsp: Is an alternative entry point. This jsp is commonly used for helps or rendering a portlet with an iframe skin.
-   includePortalTaglibs.jspf: Includes the HCL Digital Experience Portal taglibs.
