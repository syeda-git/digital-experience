# Test the custom EAR file

Test the new custom EAR file on your test server to verify that it deploys successfully.

If you already deployed the dynamic WAR file, you must uninstall the WAR file before this step because it is redeployed in the ear file. Do not delete the theme in portal when you uninstall the WAR file.

Deploy the EAR file, run the XML Access scripts to register the theme and skins. Also, update the runtime configuration as described before.

Restart your portal server and test the new custom ear file on your test server to verify that it deploys successfully.
