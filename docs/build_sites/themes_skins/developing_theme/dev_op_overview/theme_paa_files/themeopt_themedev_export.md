# Exporting theme PAA files

You can export your themes as PAA files so that you can install them on other servers.

1.  From the Theme Manager, select the theme that you want to export.

2.  Click **More actions** \> **Export**.


A message displays that indicates whether the export process was successful. If the process was successful, you can open or save the PAA file. The PAA file is named YourThemeNamePAA.paa, where YourThemeName is the unique name of your theme.

You can now use the theme PAA file to install your theme on different servers.
