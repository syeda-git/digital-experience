# Responsive Web Design

Responsive Web Design provides content parity between mobile devices and desktop channels, which enhances user experience and brand consistency. Seamless changes in screen size, from small to large, are now possible while the order of the content is maintained. Content maintenance is simplified by having one site that is represented by one set of assets.


-   **[Mobile navigation](rwd_add_navphone.md)**  
The HCL Digital Experience theme, Portal 8.5, provides two new responsive page navigation designs for mobile devices. One is aimed at smartphones, while the other is designed for tablets. The user agent for a device is parsed to determine which navigation to render on the portal page.
-   **[Standard portal pages and mobile devices](rwd_legacypages.md)**  
HCL Digital Experience has two types of pages, Standard Portal Pages and Static Pages. Static pages use HTML templates to organize layout containers and controls, and are used as the default page type since version 7.0. Standard Portal pages use table-based layouts.
-   **[Relative width CSS classes for theme layouts](../responsive_web_design/relative_width_css_classes/index.md)**  
To assist with making the elements of a page responsive to various widths, relative width CSS classes have been added to the theme layouts. These classes are marker classes only. There are no styles that are defined for these classes by default. They are there on the containers, rows and columns, of the layouts so that you can define your own styles that are associated with the classes as needed to make your page elements responsive to various widths.
