# Stylesheets

The Simple Theme template uses several stylesheets. Each stylesheet has a compressed version and an uncompressed version.

The compressed version of each stylesheet is named filename.css. Use the compressed version for improved performance. The uncompressed version of each stylesheet, named filename.uncompressed.css, can be used during development or debugging by clicking **Theme Analyzer** \> **Utilities** \> **Control Center** \> **Remote Debugging** \> **Click to turn on** for both remote debugging options.

Simple Theme CSS classes have the prefix `st`. You can change the prefix by modifying the metadata entry for `simpletheme.css.class.prefix` to the prefix that you prefer, then changing `st` in the CSS and .js files to your new value.
