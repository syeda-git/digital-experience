# Creating and deploying skins

You can use the default skin as-is, or you can create a new skin by modifying the default skin. After you create a skin, you must deploy it.

Skins provide markup for decoration around portlets, widgets, and the title bar, which contains the portlet and content menus. The Simple Theme template includes one skin template. In **View** mode, this skin does not display the title bar or any decoration. In **Edit** mode, the skin displays the title bar and the outline around the portlet. The title bar is visible only when you hover over the portlet body in **Edit** mode.

Use the following steps to create a new skin by modifying the default skin.

1.  Create a copy of the following folder in WebDAV: yourtheme/skins/Standard

2.  In the Theme Manager, select your theme and click **Manage properties**.

3.  Click **Skins**.

4.  Click **Add Skin**.

5.  Enter a title for your new skin.

6.  Click the **Advanced** tab.

7.  Enter a unique name for your new skin and make sure that the static content root field matches the name that you gave to the new folder in WebDAV.

8.  Click **Done**.


Your new skin is now deployed and ready to use.
