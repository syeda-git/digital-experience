# Deploying Site Builder



Deploy Site Builder by setting access to determine who can use Site Builder and which tools they can use. Website creators are allowed to create websites, or add new sections to existing websites, based on the site templates and section templates that are provided to them. Administrators can create websites, or add sections to existing websites, and they can create, change, and distribute Site Builder templates too.
