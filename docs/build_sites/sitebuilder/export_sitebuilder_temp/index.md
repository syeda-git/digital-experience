# Exporting Site Builder templates to other servers

Site Builder administrators can export published Site Builder templates to other HCL Digital Experience Portal servers that run Site Builder.

To copy a site template or section template to another server, use the **Export** action under the Site Builder template name. There are two export options:

-   To copy a Site Builder template to a virtual portal on the same host, you can export the Site Builder template and import all necessary files immediately to the virtual portal.
-   Otherwise, export the Site Builder template to a file, copy the file to the other Portal server, and use the **Import Site Template** action on the target server.

!!! note
    The site template name or section template name cannot exist on the target server or it does not display in the list of Site Builder templates on that server.

Exporting collects the site or section structure, the page templates, and any required libraries that you added to the template. Portlets and themes are not included because they are included with base portal.

With direct access to a virtual portal setup on HCL Digital Experience, exporting collects all the necessary files and imports them immediately.
-   **[Exporting a Site Builder template to a file](../sitebuilder/sitebuilder_temp_dist_man.md)**  
 HCL Digital Experience users can export a Site Builder site or section template to a file and import it to the target server later.
