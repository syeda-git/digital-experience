After adding a site or section, use the toolbar to add content to your site or section.

For example, when you use the Simple site template, the site created with this template includes only a single home page. You can then:

-   Rename the page.
-   Add a new section using Site Builder.
-   Add further pages using Site Manager.
-   Add Page Components using the Site Toolbar.
-   Add content using Site Manager.

To learn more about adding further pages and content, go to [Adding pages, content, and more](../../create_sites/adding_pages_content_more/index.md).

To get a tour of the authoring capabilities of Site Manager, go to [Exploring site toolbar and site manager](../../create_sites/adding_pages_content_more/toolbar_sm_ovr.md).
