title: Content libraries for sites created with Site Builder
---


The user that runs the Site Wizard can determine where the content for a new site will be stored. This selection does not apply to the Section Wizard. For sections, the content library is determined by the selected anchor page.

A good practice is to store content in a library that is distinct from other site assets such as workflows, presentation and authoring templates and pages.

The pages created from the template are always stored in the Portal Site library. The content displayed in these pages can be stored and managed in the Portal Site library, or stored and managed separately in either a new or existing library. The strategy you select here will depend on whether you want to manage your pages and content created by this template in a single library, or manage each site or section created by this template in separate libraries with individual syndication and access control strategies.

## Portal Site library

The Portal Site library is used system wide to store pages. The benefit of storing your content in the Portal Site library is that syndication and access control strategies for both the pages and content are controlled and managed within a single library.

If your page templates are associated with content stored in the Portal Site library, you must use this library. If you plan to export these templates for use on a different server, selecting the Portal Site Library can result in conflicts if existing managed templates have been used.

## Create a content library

Use this option to create a library every time a new site is created with a site template. This option allows access controls and syndication to be managed uniquely for each new library. This option is not available if content that is associated with the page template is stored in the Portal Site library. For example, the Basic and Articles page templates store default content in the Portal Site library and cannot be used with a new library.

## Select an existing content library

This option is similar to creating a new content library except the syndication and access control strategies are based on the existing library you select here.
