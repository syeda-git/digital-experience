# Selecting libraries in Site Builder



The libraries that you select when you use Site Builder determine what changes you or others can make to a published site.

<!--
-   **[Required libraries in Site Builder](sitebuilder_learn_lib_req.md)**  
Required libraries contain supporting assets that are referenced by page templates that are used in your site or section template.
-   **[Content libraries for site templates](sitebuilder_learn_lib_cont_temp.md)**  
The user that creates the site template can select a default content library for any sites that are created from the template. The user that runs the Site Wizard can change this selection. This selection does not apply to the Section Wizard. For sections, the content library is determined by the selected anchor page.
-   **[Content libraries for sites created with Site Builder](sitebuilder_learn_lib_cont_user.md)**  
The user that runs the Site Wizard can determine where the content for a new site will be stored. This selection does not apply to the Section Wizard. For sections, the content library is determined by the selected anchor page.
-   **[Hiding libraries in Site Builder](sitebuilder_lib_hide.md)**  
You can prevent libraries from being shown to website creators and administrators that use Site Builder on a particular server. When you hide a library, it does not display in Site Builder, either as a required library or as a library that can be chosen for storing content. Hidden libraries are also excluded from exported site template packages. The content library selection, "Use the existing portal content library \(Portal Site\)" is always shown to users. -->
