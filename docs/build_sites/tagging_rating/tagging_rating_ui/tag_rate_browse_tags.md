# Browsing tags

Besides tagging content and viewing tags users can browse tags. This can be useful for finding related or similar content.

For example, when a user views a resource such as a weather portlet, the user might want to know if there are similar portlets available. In this case the user can select the **Browse tags** feature to search resources tagged with the same tags, and optionally additional ones.

For a page users select the **Browse Tags** option from the Actions menu link in the page header. For a portlet users select the **Browse Tags** option from the portlet menu.

Clicking **Browse Tags** redirects the user to the tag center. The tag cloud shows the **All** view. The user can now select tags and views as required.
