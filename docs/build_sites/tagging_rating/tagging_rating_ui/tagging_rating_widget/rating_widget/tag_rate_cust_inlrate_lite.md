# Customizing the rating widget

The user interface of the rating widget consists of Web Content Manager HTML components. You can customize the rating widgets by modifying one or more of these components. For example, you can change the order of the user interface elements, or you can remove a field that you do not want to show in the user interface. The components are listed here.

Changes that you make here apply to all instances of the rating widget.

Some of the components are mandatory. Do not remove them.
