# Tagging and rating with anonymous users

Anonymous users of the portal can tag and rate portal content, if an administrator adds the anonymous user to the appropriate roles on the virtual resources as described in the topic about Security for tagging and rating.

As the portal cannot distinguish one anonymous user from another, there are some side effects that need to be understood:

-   For tagging, the same user can normally not apply the same tag to the same resource more than once, but an anonymous user can apply the same tag more than once.
-   For rating, the same user can normally rate a single resource only once, but an anonymous user can rate the same resource more than once.
-   Anonymous users cannot view their personal tags, and they cannot delete tags or ratings.
-   Anonymous users cannot tag or rate a page with the Search and Tag Center profile deployed on it.
