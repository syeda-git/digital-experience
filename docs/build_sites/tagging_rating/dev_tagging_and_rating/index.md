# Extending tagging and rating by using service APIs

Developers can enhance and extend the tagging and rating features of the portal. For this purpose the portal tagging and rating feature provides service APIs that you can use to enhance tagging and rating by your requirements.

The portal provides a Java Model API and a RESTful API that relates to tagging and rating. You can also extend the included Dojo widget user interface. For example, you can enhance portal tagging and rating in the following ways:

-   You can create additional queries about different aspects of the tagging and rating behavior of your portal users.
-   You can build additional user interfaces to show the statistics about the tagging and rating behavior of your portal users.
-   You can implement additional functionality by exploiting the tags via the access to shared render parameters. Thereby portlets on a page can react to what is currently happening in the tag widget.

<!--
-   **[The Java API](../admin-system/tag_rate_api_java.md)**  
The Java API that the portal provides for tagging and rating follows the pattern of the portal controller SPI. For more details refer to the section about the portal controller API.
-   **[The REST API](../admin-system/tag_rate_api_rest.md)**  
The REST API provides various possibilities to work with tagging and rating. -->
