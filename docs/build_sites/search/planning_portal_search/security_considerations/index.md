# Security considerations

Learn about the security aspects that you need to consider with regards to content search in HCL Digital Experience Version 8.5.

-   **[Search on secured Portal Search collections and other secured content sources](srtsrchcllcandothcntsrcs.md)**  
Portal search collections are portal resources. You can therefore secure them through Portal Access Control. Consequently, users can only access and search collections to which they have access permission.
-   **[Searching on secured portal sites and pages and content management items](srtsrchscrprtlstepgs.md)**  
For search on a secured local portal site, Portal Search provides a pre-configured search collection. You can also set up your own search collection for searching your portal site.
-   **[Encrypting sensitive data](srtencrpsnstdt.md)**  
When you create a new content source using the Manage Search portlet, some secured content sources require that you enter sensitive data. For example, this can be the user ID and password of the crawler user ID required for accessing the secured content source. When you later export the configuration of the search collection, you might want to protect the sensitive data. You can encrypt such sensitive data so that it is not stored as plain text on the hard drive. If you do not encrypt such data, the data is not included in the export.
-   **[Configuring web server security](srt_cfg_sec_https.md)**  
For security reasons, the portal search seedlist by default redirects to HTTPs. Therefore, you need to configure your web server for HTTPs.
