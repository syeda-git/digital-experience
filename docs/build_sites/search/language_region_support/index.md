Internet search engines usually take care of language support in terms of language determination and language specific processing.
-   **[Region support and multi-regional sites](../language_region_support/region_multiregion_support/index.md)**  
Global companies might choose to publish content, and offer products or services specifically for certain regions. While today a language can be detected, there is no technical solution available to detect a region.
