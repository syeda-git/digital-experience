# Manage Search




You can customize the way the portal search is administered to meet your users need from the Manage Search portlet. The Manage Search portlet provides access to search related resources such as the Search Services, Search Collections, Search Scopes, and custom links. You can use these resources to search for content more effectively. You can view and manage the resources from the Manage Search portlet.

View and work with the following search-related resources from the Manage Search portlet:


-   **[Search Services](srch_srvs.md)**  
You can search for content more effectively with the Search Services as it represents separate instances of the provided search engine. To search your local portal choose the Portal Search Service Type and to search for HCL Connections content choose the Remote Content Server search services Type \(RCSS\). For a cluster portal environment, you need to set up a remote search service. To set it up choose the Portal Search Service Type and follow the directions of configuring a remote search service. For more information, see Remote search service and Configuring search with Remote Content Server Search Service Type \(RCSS\). You can manage the Search Collections and the Content Sources that are contained within the Search Service. The content source contains portal pages, content that is managed by HCL Web Content Manager, or indexed web pages.
-   **[Search Collections](../manage_search/search_collection/index.md)**  
You can build and maintain Search Collections of web content, Web Content Manager content, and portal content. Users can then search these collections by using the portal search center. You can access Search Collections from the Manage Search portlet page to view and manage all Search Collections across various Search Services. To view and manage specific Search Collections for a specific Search Service, click the **Search Service** name from the Search Services page.
-   **[Search Scopes and Custom Links](../manage_search/searchscopes_customlinks/index.md)**  
From **Search Scopes**, you can modify, add, edit, or delete search scopes and custom links. The search scopes are displayed to users as search options in the menu list of the search box in the banner and in the Search Center portlet. Users can select the scope relevant for their search queries.
