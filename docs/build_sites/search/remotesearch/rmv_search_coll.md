# Removing search collections

If you plan to use search in a cluster, you must configure a remote search server. If you created any search collections, you must re-create them on the remote search server. If your search collection has data, export the collection before you delete it. Then, import it to the remote server.

1.  Prevent the creation of search collections. To do so, complete the substeps listed here.

    !!! note
        If you have CF07 or a later fix pack installed, start the portal configuration engine task `suppress-automatic-search-service-creation` to prevent the creation of search collections. You do not need to perform the substeps listed here. After running the configuration task, continue with the next main step that deletes all search collections from the primary node.

    1.  Log in to the WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console.
