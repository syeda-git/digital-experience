Before you can begin using remote search service, you must create two new search collections, one for JCR search, and one for Portal search.

1.  Manually create a JCR search collection by following the instructions that are outlined in [Setting up a JCR search collection](../../portal_search/administer_portal_search/setup_search_collections/jcr_search_collections/index.md).
