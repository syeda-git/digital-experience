# Searching your local portal

View information on setting up your local portal for your users to search.

The portal default search collection combines two content sources and their related crawlers:

-   The Portal Content Source. This contains the local portal site, where users can search for portal pages and portlets.
-   The Web Content Manager (WCM) Content Source, which users can search for web content.
