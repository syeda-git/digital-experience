# Crawling a remote portal site

Configure Portal Search to crawl and index a remote, public portal site.

You can enable search on other portal sites. However, only the public pages of other portals can be searched. When you start the crawl, the public portion of the portal site is crawled. The search collection contains only public pages.

Use the following steps to enable crawling on a selected portal site.

1.  Create a content source by using the Manage Search portlet.

2.  Select **Web site** from the drop-down menu.

3.  Enter the URL of the portal site that you want to make available for search by your users.
