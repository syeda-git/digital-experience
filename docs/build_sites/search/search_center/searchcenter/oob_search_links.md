# Configure keywords for suggested links


You can add search keywords to specific pages to promote those pages in search results. When a site visitor searches for the keyword, search results display in the Search Center. The Suggested Links portlet might also display additional links. The suggested links have the same keyword defined as the visitorâ€™s search term. Suggested links help you direct your site visitors to priority content.

-   Log in as an administrator to add the Suggested Links portlet to the search center.
-   Ensure tagging is enabled. For more information see [Tagging and rating](../../../tagging_rating/index.md).
-   Ensure the Dojo tagging and rating options are enabled for your Search and Tag Center profile. For more information see [Enabling and disabling the Dojo tagging and rating options for additional profiles](../../../tagging_rating/cfg_reference/tag_rate_nbldsbl_dojo_options.md).

This procedure demonstrates how you can add a keyword to content to generate a suggested link. You can configure the amount of links the Suggested Links portlet displays.

1.  Search for the document to which you want to add one or more keywords for suggested links.

2.  In the search results list, click **Edit keywords for Suggested Links**.

3.  Add or edit the keywords that you want to associate with this page.

4.  Save your updates.


When visitors search for a keyword that you also added to content, the content is listed in the Suggested Links portlet.
