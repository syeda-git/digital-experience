# Managing global settings

Define the settings for your portal server. These settings include the default portal language, the first page displayed when a user logs in, the option to set a URL for the Find feature, and what will be displayed when a user is not authorized to view a portlet.

When you have completed your option selection, click **Save**. To restore to the previous selection of options, click **Reset**.

A message informs you for which portal server you are setting portal settings.

!!! note
    The **Global Settings** portlet does not work in portal cluster configurations.
