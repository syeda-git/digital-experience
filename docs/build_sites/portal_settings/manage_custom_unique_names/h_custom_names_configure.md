You can specify the number of resources that you want to be listed on the page, configure how the resources will appear to all users or to particular instances of the portlet, or make individual changes to the portlet, depending on the available options and the task that you want to perform.

Depending on your access rights, you can configure or edit some of the standard features of the Manage Custom Unique Names portlet. To configure or edit the portlet, proceed as follows:

    -   If you want to make individual changes to the portlet, click **Personalize**.
    The panel for configuring, editing, or personalizing the portlet settings appears.

4.  Enter the required numbers and make the required selections:

    -   **Never show more than this number of items**
