# Administering Portlet load monitoring

You can administer Portlet load monitoring and the portlets that it monitors. You can determine whether and in which cases Portlet load monitoring blocks or reenables a portlet by setting its portlet preferences. You can also check which portlets **Portlet load monitoring** monitors, and you can manually block or activate these portlets. For example, you can reenable a portlet after Portlet load monitoring has blocked it.
