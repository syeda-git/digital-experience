You create the visual designs for your social rendering view definitions by using social rendering appearance components. Social rendering appearance components are implemented as  HCL Web Content Manager Personalization components. Personalization components that you use with social rendering must wrap a Digital Data Connector \(DDC\) for HCL Portal selection rule.
