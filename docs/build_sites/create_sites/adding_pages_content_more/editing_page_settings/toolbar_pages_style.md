title: Changing page style
---


You can change the appearance of a page by selecting a style from the list of styles. Available styles are defined in the website theme. The site administrator selects the theme.

Edit Mode must be on to change the page style.

Pages that use the default style have no custom style sheet applied. Default style pages inherit the styles that are applied to the parent page.

1.  In site manager, click the context menu for the page that you want to change.

2.  Click **Open Page Settings**.

3.  In the Edit Page form, click the **Style** tab.

4.  Select the style. The selection takes effect immediately.
