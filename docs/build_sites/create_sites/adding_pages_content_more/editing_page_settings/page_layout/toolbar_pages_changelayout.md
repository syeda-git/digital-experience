You can select a different page layout from a list of predefined layouts.

To help you anticipate how the layout change renders on different devices, each layout option provides three thumbnail views: desktop computer, tablet, and mobile device.

Content, portlets, and widgets are automatically positioned into the new layout. Content that cannot be placed into the new layout is hidden content. After you select the new layout, you can manually place hidden content.

Edit Mode must be on to change the page layout.

1.  In site manager, click the context menu for the page that you want to change.

2.  Click **Open Page Settings** from the menu.

3.  In the Edit Page form, click the **Layout** tab.

4.  Click the new layout that you want to apply to the page.

    The page immediately updates to reflect your selection.

5.  If there are hidden items, select how you want to place the hidden items.

    You can manually place the items on the page or delete the items.
