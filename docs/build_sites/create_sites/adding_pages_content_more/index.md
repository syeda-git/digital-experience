# Adding pages, content, and more

As a content author, your goal is to visualize the best way to organize information on your site with pages and content. You might need to create a section in the site for a new product or you might want to change the arrangement of pages in the navigation based on customer feedback. Either way, you always start with a project and end with publishing your updates.

-   **Create a project to organize drafts and for easy publishing**

    -   Projects organize your drafts in a centralized view and give you the flexibility of approving and publishing content in one step.
    
    -   To get started, click the project menu to create a new project or access an existing project.

-   **Create draft pages and content in your project. Use site manager to visualize how your new pages and content look in the site navigation.**

    -   From site manager, you can see draft pages and content in the context of the site navigation. By default, content items are hidden from the site manager tree view. Click ![Screen capture of the Show content items in the tree view icon](../../../images/show_content.jpg) **Show content items in the tree view** to display content items in the site manager tree view.
    -   To set up your site with new pages or content, open the site toolbar and site manager. Select an existing page or content item in site manager, and click the context menu icon ![Screen capture of the context menu](../../../images/toolbar_context_menu.jpg) to access the create options. The following image shows how to access the context menu for a page in site manager.

    -   All pages and content are created from templates in site manager for easy site setup. Page templates include page layout and can include content. Content templates include a default appearance and structure.
    -   Site manager includes extra features that content authors frequently use while setting up the site. These features include copying and pasting areas of your navigation as the starting point for new content, changing page layout, changing style, and more.

-   **Publish your project**

    All of your changes look great and you submit your edits for approval. After your drafts are approved, publish the project to update your site with your changes. To publish your project, open the project menu in the action bar. From the project menu, you can select **Publish** to publish your project immediately, or click **Open Overview** to view the contents of your project before you publish.

## Next Steps

-   Start with a tour of the site toolbar and site manager. Familiarize yourself with creating pages and content in the context of your site navigation in *Exploring site toolbar and site manager*.
-   Then, learn the details of how to set up your site.-->

-   **[Exploring site toolbar and site manager](toolbar_sm_ovr.md)**  
Site toolbar and site manager provide quick access to common content author tools as well as a complete view of your site's navigation. Without leaving the context of your website, content authors can create and modify pages and content items, create vanity URLs for promotions, and much more.
-   **[Projects: Organizing and coordinating changes to your site](../adding_pages_content_more/projects_organizing_coord_chgs_site/index.md)**  
Projects organize related updates to the published site and simplify the publication process. You can think of projects as folders that contain related draft updates to the published site. Content owners create projects from project templates. Content authors contribute updates to the projects that content owners create. Updates could include moving a page in the site navigation, creating a new page, adding content to a page, and more. When content authors are ready, they can send their content for approval and publishing.
-   **[Creating pages with page templates](toolbar_sm_page_create.md)**  
 From site manager, you can create pages based on templates and see your draft pages in context of the site navigation. Page creation is as simple as providing a name, using the generated friendly URL name, and selecting your template.
-   **[Creating content with content templates](toolbar_content_create.md)**  
From site manager, you can create content items based on templates and see your content items in the context of the site navigation. Content creation is similar to page creation; simply provide a content title, use the generated content URL, and specify a content template to create a content item.
-   **[Viewing your content from the content explorer](../adding_pages_content_more/viewing_content_from_content_explorer/index.md)**  
 The tree view in site manager does not always provide you with a complete view of the content items on a page. In contrast, the content explorer in site manager provides you with a list of content items, site areas, and associated content for a selected page. From the content explorer, you can select an item from the list and click the context menu to see options for working with your content.
-   **[Adding reusable page components to your page](toolbar_add_comp.md)**  
Page components are reusable assets that content authors can add to a page to display different types of content. Page components are in the site toolbar, which you can access by clicking the site toolbar icon. Page components display on the page and do not display in site manager and content explorer.
-   **[Adding applications to your page](toolbar_add_app.md)**  
Applications are reusable portlets that you can add to a page to show content items in different formats. Applications can also enable the completion of a task, such as viewing external search results or adding someone to your Sametime list. Applications display on the page where you add them and do not display in site manager nor in content explorer.
-   **[Moving, copying, and pasting pages and content items](toolbar_pages_move.md)**  
You can move or copy a page or a content item to a different position in the page hierarchy. Child pages and content items move with the parent page. Associated content remains associated with the page, but does not move.
-   **[Editing page settings](../adding_pages_content_more/editing_page_settings/index.md)**  
After you create a page, modify the page settings to change the page title, create a friendly URL name, and more. To access page settings for an existing page, click the page in site manager and click the context menu icon. Then, click **Open Page Settings.**
