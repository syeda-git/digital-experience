title: Moving, copying, and pasting pages and content items
---




You can move or copy a page or a content item to a different position in the page hierarchy. Child pages and content items move with the parent page. Associated content remains associated with the page, but does not move.

Edit Mode must be on to move or copy pages or content items.

When you move a page or a content item, you place it relative to another page or a content item in the website hierarchy.

1.  In site manager, click the context menu icon ![Screen capture of the context menu](../../../images/toolbar_context_menu.jpg) for the page or content item that you want to move or copy and paste.

2.  Choose one of the following options:

    -   Select **Copy Content** to create a copy of a content item. The original content item is not modified.
    -   Select **Move Content** to cut the content item so you can paste it somewhere else in the website hierarchy.
    -   Select **Copy Page** to create a copy of a page. The original page is not modified.
    -   Select **Move Page** to cut the page so you can paste it somewhere else in the website hierarchy.
    
3.  Decide where you want to move the content item or page relative to another page or content item in the website hierarchy.

4.  In site manager, click the context menu icon ![Screen capture of the context menu](../../../images/toolbar_context_menu.jpg) for that page or content item and select one of the following options:

    -   Select **Paste Reference to Page** to add a reference to a content item on a page. A web content viewer portlet is added to the page and displays the content item with a summary presentation appearance.

        !!! note
            Clicking **Paste Reference to Page** is the same as clicking **Add Reference to Page** from the context menu of a content item. This reference is not a new copy of the original content item, which means that if you delete the original content item, an empty web content viewer portlet displays on the page. You can delete the original content item that the web content viewer portlet references by using the content menu in the web content viewer title bar. You can delete the web content viewer portlet by using the portlet menu in the web content viewer title bar. Deleting the web content viewer portlet removes the reference from the page without affecting the original content item.

        Alternatively, you can drag the content item and drop it onto the page in the website. This operation will also add a reference to the content item to the page.

    -   Select **Paste as Child** to paste the content item or page as a child to a page. This option is only available in the context menu of a page. You cannot paste a content item or a page as a child to a content item.

    -   Select **Paste as Sibling** to paste the content item or page as a sibling to a page or content item. This option is available in the context menu of both pages and content items.
