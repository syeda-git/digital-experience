Edit mode is available from the site toolbar.

## Edit mode and administration pages

Administration pages are not intended to be edited. These pages are excluded from the edit mode features provided by the site toolbar. The administration pages are not managed in the Web Content Manager. The edit mode features are suppressed by the page parameter "theme.disable.edit.mode" on the Administration page label (unique name wps.Administration). Setting the parameter on the top-level administration page also causes the child pages to be affected.

## Disable edit mode

You can set the "theme.disable.edit.mode" parameter on any page where you want to disable edit mode in the site toolbar. Edit the properties of the page, and add the "theme.disable.edit.mode" parameter with a value of "true".
