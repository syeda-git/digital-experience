# Authoring tools

There are multiple ways to create and manage content including using the site toolbar, inline editing, and the authoring portlet.


-   **[Site toolbar and site manager](site_site_toolbar.md)**  
The site toolbar and site manager are useful for managing and editing content day-to-day. They provide convenient access to many capabilities directly from the website. Content authors can create pages, add content and application to pages, and manage page parameters.
-   **[Edit mode](site_edit_mode.md)**  
Edit mode is available from the site toolbar.
-   **[Web content inline editing strategies](../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/inline_editing/index.md)**  
An inline editing system is used to deliver editable websites such as an intranet or a wiki. It combines the features of both an authoring system and a delivery system.
-   **[Authoring portlet](site_auth_portlet.md)**  
The authoring portlet is another interface that can be used by content authors, site administrators, and site developers. From the authoring portlet, content authors use forms, called authoring templates, to add content to the website. You can use to customize the Web Content Manager user interface to simplify the content authoring process for your content creators.
