The site toolbar and site manager are useful for managing and editing content day-to-day. They provide convenient access to many capabilities directly from the website. Content authors can create pages, add content and application to pages, and manage page parameters.

The site toolbar and site manager are available for immediate use after you deploy the portal with Combined Cumulative Fix 8 or later. The availability of the site toolbar and site manager is controlled by the theme. So you can disable them on your production server.

## Site toolbar and site manager customization

The site toolbar and site manager are populated with the portlets that are immediately available after you deploy the portal. They include a number of configured content viewers. To customize your toolbar and site manager, you can:

-   Add page templates to the Create Page dialog

-   Add new categories and applications to the site toolbar

-   Hide or display authoring templates from the Create Content dialog
