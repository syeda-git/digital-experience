# Hiding content

You can hide portlets and widgets on a page so they are present but not visible in the page layout.

Why Hide Content?

Sometimes you might want a portlet or widget on the page, but it does not have a user interface. In that case, it should be hidden. An example is if you have a data processing widget and a data viewer widget that are wired together. The data viewer widget is visible and the data processing widget would stay hidden.

In the portal theme, hide content by putting it into a special container in the layout that is hidden with CSS. All of the out of box layout templates have this hidden container.
