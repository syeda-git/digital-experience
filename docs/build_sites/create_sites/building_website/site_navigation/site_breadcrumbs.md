title: Adding page-level navigation
---


The default portal theme automatically adds page-level navigation to your site based on the page hierarchy of your site.

Page-level navigation is added to static pages using these portlets:

-   **The Breadcrumb Trail portlet**

    The Breadcrumb Trail portlet allows you to add the navigation path to your static pages. The breadcrumb trail starts at the content root and goes down to the currently selected static page.

-   **The Navigation portlet**

    The Navigation portlet allows you to add dynamic portal navigation to a static page. When writing a static portal page you can configure the starting point of the navigation and the number of navigation levels by using the initialization parameters.
