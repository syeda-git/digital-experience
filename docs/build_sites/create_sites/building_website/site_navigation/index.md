# Navigation


Navigation is defined by your page hierarchy and your site area hierarchy. Navigation elements include your page theme, menus, and navigators.

## Hierarchical navigation

The hierarchical structure of your website is displayed to users in different ways.

-   **Page navigation**

    The top levels of navigation are defined by your page hierarchy, and are automatically displayed by the default portal theme as links. The location of these links is determined by the page layout you select.

-   **Site area navigation**

    If your website includes web content, extra navigational links are displayed with a navigator component. This component type displays a subsection of the hierarchical structure of the site areas and content items that are used by your website.


## Criteria based navigation

Use menu components to display lists of links to your web content based on predefined or dynamic criteria. The parameters that are defined in a menu component can be based on set criteria, such as a category or authoring template, or they can be set with dynamic criteria that are based on the current content item, site area, or other variables.


-   **[Creating links and navigation](site_wayfinding.md)**  
Use navigators and menus to create links to content, and display content-level navigation.
-   **[Adding page-level navigation](site_breadcrumbs.md)**  
The default portal theme automatically adds page-level navigation to your site based on the page hierarchy of your site.
-   **[Hiding and displaying pages in the navigation](show_hidden_page.md)**  
By default, pages that you create are displayed in the navigation of the portal site. If you do not want a page that you create to appear in the navigation, you can hide the page by setting the com.ibm.portal.Hidden page parameter to `true`. While this parameter does not affect your portal access control settings for the page, it is hidden from the navigation.
