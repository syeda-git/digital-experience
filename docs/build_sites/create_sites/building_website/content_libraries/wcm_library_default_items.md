# Web content library default items

When you create a web content library, you can choose to include a set of default web content items in the new library. These items can be used as a starting point for your Web Content Manager system and website.

## Access controls

As the web content library default items are configured to inherit their access settings from the library they are stored in, users are not able to access these items until you configure the access settings of the library.

## Viewing default items

The default items are best displayed by using a web content viewer portlet:

1.  To open the **Manage Pages** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal User Interface** \> **Manage Pages**.
2.  Select **New Page From**.
3.  Under **Web Content Mappings**, select the site area that is named **Articles** from your web content library.
4.  Complete the rest of the form and click OK.
5.  Edit the page layout of the new page and add a **Web Content Viewer** portlet to the page.
6.  The content item that is named **Sample Article** is displayed on the page.
