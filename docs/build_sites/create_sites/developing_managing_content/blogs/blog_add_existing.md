# Adding existing blogs or blog libraries to a page

If you created a blog or blog library for another page and now want to use it again, add a web content viewer to the new page and edit its settings to point to the existing blog or blog library.

1.  Create a project or access an existing project, and open the project in edit mode.

2.  If you did not already, create a page for the existing blog or blog library or open an existing page.

    !!! note
        Blog and Blog Library require a certain amount of horizontal screen space to render properly, and are therefore not intended for small mobile devices such as smartphones. For some tablet and desktop situations with limited horizontal screen space, use the portlets in a one-column layout.

3.  Click the **Content** tab.

4.  Click **All** in the list of categories, and search for the portlet **Web Content Viewer**.

5.  Add the web content viewer to your page by clicking the plus sign \(+\) or dragging the viewer onto the page.

6.  Click **Save**.

7.  Click the drop-down menu that is in the web content viewer title bar, and select **Edit Shared Settings**.

8.  Under Content Type, select **Content Item**.

9.  Under Content, click **Edit**.

10. Click **Libraries**.

11. Click the library that contains the blog or blog library you want to add.

12. Expand the selected library to see the blog or blog library you want to use.

13. Select the blog or blog library and click **OK**.

14. Click **Apply** to save your changes to the web content viewer.

15. Click **Advanced Options**.

16. Ensure the **Broadcast links to** option is set to **None** or **This Portal page**.

17. Ensure the **Receive links from** option is set to **This portlet only** or **Other portlets and this portlet**.

18. Click **OK**.


!!! note
    Tagged web content that is displayed in the web content viewer is only available when there is a single instance of this portlet on the page. When you click a tag result, the Tag Center broadcasts the information on what content displays in the viewer with a public render parameter. If you have multiple instances of web content that is displayed in the web content viewer, then these instances display the content that you tagged rather than display the original content of these instances.
