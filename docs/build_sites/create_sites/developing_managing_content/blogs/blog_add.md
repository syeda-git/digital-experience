# Adding a blog or blog library to a page

With Editor access to the portal or the portal page, you can add a blog or blog library to a page. Choose a blog to collaborate with your team on a single topic. Choose a blog library to collaborate with your team on multiple topics in a centralized view.

1.  Create a project or access an existing project, and open the project in edit mode.

2.  If you did not already, create a page for the existing blog or blog library or open an existing page.

    !!! note
        Blog and Blog Library require a certain amount of horizontal screen space to render properly, and are not supported on mobile devices. For desktop applications with limited horizontal screen space, use the portlets in a one-column layout.

3.  Click the **Content** tab, then click **Communications**.

4.  Click **Blog Library** to add a team blog or click **Blog** to create a single-topic blog.

5.  Click **Add to page**.

6.  Provide a name. Then, click **Add**.

    The name is used for the portlet title, library display title, and library name. It can contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, and the following characters: $ - \_ . ! \( \) ,. If you use other characters, they are replaced by characters that are supported by the Web Content Manager library.

7.  Click **Save Draft**.

    This action copies the appropriate HCL Web Content Manager blog template library and places an instance of the web content viewer on the page.


After you publish the site with a blog library, click **Create Blog** and **Create Post** to add content. Click **Edit** to modify content. To delete a post, click **Delete**.

After you publish the site with a blog, click **Create Post** to add content. Click **Edit** to modify content. To delete a post, click **Delete**.

!!! note 
    Tagged web content that is displayed in the web content viewer is only available when there is a single instance of this portlet on the page. When you click a tag result, the Tag Center broadcasts the information on what content displays in the viewer with a public render parameter. If you have multiple instances of web content displayed in the web content viewer, then these instances display the content that you tagged rather than display the original content of these instances.
