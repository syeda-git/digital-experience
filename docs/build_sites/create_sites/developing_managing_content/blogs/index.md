# Blogs

Use blogs and blog libraries to provide news and commentary on a variety of subjects pertinent to your intranet and extranet sites. Blogs and blog libraries typically combine text with graphics and links to other blogs and websites. Entries that you create and post are arranged in reverse-chronological order, with the newest entry displayed first. Readers can post comments about your entries, fostering discussions and online networking. You can manage your own blog entries and comment on other blog entries. You can also incorporate tagging and rating as you would with other WebSphere Portal content.

!!! tip
    Use a blog for sharing information on a single subject. Use a blog library to share information on multiple discussions.
