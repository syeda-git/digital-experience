# Assigning blog access to users

The Portal administrator can assign Editor access to you if you need to create and manage blogs within the site. If you are given Editor access to a blog, you can create or modify posts in that blog. If you are given Editor rights to a blog library, you can create and modify blogs and you can create and modify posts in that blog library. If you have Manager rights to a blog, you can create, modify, and delete posts and delete comments in that blog. If you are given Manager rights to a blog library, you can create, modify, and delete blogs. You can also create, modify, and delete posts and delete comments within the blogs.

For an example of assigning access to users, refer to the following instructions for adding users to the Editor role:

1.  Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal Content** \> **Web Content Libraries**.

2.  Go to the library that contains the blog you want to manage and click **Set permissions**.

3.  Click **Edit Role** for the Editor role.

4.  Click **Add** to assign users or groups to the Editor role. Search for the users or groups that belong to this role.


For example, the settings in the following table allow all authenticated users to create new blogs, but restricts them to posting only in blogs they created. Use the **Set Permissions** and **Library Resources** options from the Web Content Library page to assign the following settings:

|Access settings|Group|Access level|Other settings|

|Presentation Templates|All Authenticated Portal Users|Contributor|Do not select "Allow propagation"|
