# Deleting wikis

If you are the owner of a wiki site, you have Manager access and can delete any wiki or wiki pages on that site.

You can delete a wiki and all its pages by deleting the wiki from a project.

1.  Create a project or access an existing project, and open the project in edit mode.

2.  Open the page that contains the wiki.

3.  From the site toolbar, click **More** \> **Delete Page**.

4.  Click **OK**.

5.  Publish the project.
