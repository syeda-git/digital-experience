# Wikis

Use wikis to share community content on a variety of subjects pertinent to your intranet and extranet sites. Wikis typically combine text with graphics and links to other wikis and websites. You can monitor and manage your own wiki articles.


-   **[Learn about the template libraries used by wikis](wiki_templates.md)**  
Wikis use the template libraries provided by HCL Web Content Manager. Wikis use the Web Resources v70 library and the Wiki v70 library. The page hierarchy that is provided for wikis is the common one defined by the Web Content Manager template libraries.
-   **[Adding a wiki to a page](wiki_add.md)**  
With Editor access to the portal or the portal page, you can add a wiki to a page to quickly create and edit content in-line.
-   **[Adding existing wikis to a page](wiki_add_existing.md)**  
If you created a wiki for another page and now want to use it again, add a web content viewer to the new page and edit its settings to point to the existing wiki.
-   **[Assigning wiki access to users](wiki_assign_access.md)**  
If you are the administrator, you have Site Manager access and can assign Editor access to other users who need to create and manage wikis within the site. If you are the owner of a wiki site, you have Manager access. As wiki site Manager, you can also delete any wiki page or wiki. If you have Editor access, you can create and edit any wiki site and wiki pages. All wiki editors can modify all pages of a wiki site.
-   **[Deleting wikis](wiki_delete.md)**  
If you are the owner of a wiki site, you have Manager access and can delete any wiki or wiki pages on that site.
-   **[Purging deleted wiki pages](wiki_delete_page.md)**  
When you delete a wiki post, it is removed from the site, but remains in the delete view in HCL Web Content Manager. Users with Administrator access to libraries can purge these deleted wiki pages, which optimizes performance of the wiki library. Purging the deleted wiki pages removes all occurrences, including all versions. You cannot restore deleted items after you purge them. -->
