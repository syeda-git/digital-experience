# Purging deleted wiki pages

When you delete a wiki post, it is removed from the site, but remains in the delete view in HCL Web Content Manager. Users with Administrator access to libraries can purge these deleted wiki pages, which optimizes performance of the wiki library. Purging the deleted wiki pages removes all occurrences, including all versions. You cannot restore deleted items after you purge them.

1.  Select **Applications** \> **Content** \> **Web Content Management**.

2.  In the Library Explorer, select the wiki library that contains the pages that you want to purge.

    **Tip:** If you do not see your library, click **Preferences** \> **Configure** \> **Library Selection** to add the library to the selection list.

3.  Select **Item Views** \> **Deleted Items**.

4.  Select the appropriate wiki page and click **Purge**. Click **OK**.
