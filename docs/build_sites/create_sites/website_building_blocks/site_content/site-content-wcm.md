# Content stored in Web Content Manager

Use Web Content Manager to store and manage content. Web Content Manager separates the content from the presentation layer. Content authors enter information in authoring templates. The authoring template is then associated with a presentation template. The presentation template defines how the content is rendered and presented to the site visitor. As a result, you can rapidly change the look and feel of your content without editing the same elements repeatedly. Use the Web Content Viewer Portlet to render content from Web Content Manager.
