# Customizing page creation and page editing options

When content authors edit a page, they can choose layouts and styles. As an administrator, you can customize these page editing options. If you are on Combined Cumulative Fix 8 or later, you can also customize page creation for your content authors.

You can customize page settings to include other layouts and styles that content authors can use when they edit a page. The styles and layouts that are available in page settings are included as a part of the theme. However, you can add other styles and layouts without modifying the existing theme.

When content authors create a new page, they can choose from a list of predefined page templates. As an administrator, you can customize this list. You can sort the list of page templates in the Create Page dialog by order of importance.

You can also control whether hidden pages always show in Site Manager or if you want content authors to have the option to hide hidden pages from site manager.

With Combined Cumulative Fix 8 or later, you access the page settings from the context menu of a page in site manager.


-   **[Customizing page templates in the Create Page dialog](epc_custom_page_dialog.md)**  
The hierarchy tree control makes it possible for HCL Digital Experience users to create new child and sibling pages based on predefined page templates.
-   **[Creating new styles or layouts by using a JSON file](rwd_add_layout_outside.md)**  
You can add new styles or layouts to the site toolbar with a JSON file. Sometimes components outside of the theme want to contribute a new style or layout, without editing existing theme files. Components can easily be added to the theme through a catalog deliverable by using scripting and the Solutions Installer.
-   **[Displaying hidden pages in Site Manager](toolbar_sm_disply_hidden.md)**  
 You can use metadata to control the display of hidden pages in the tree view of site manger. Your settings determine if users have the option to display or hide hidden pages or to always view hidden pages in Site Manager. Hidden pages never display in your site navigation.
