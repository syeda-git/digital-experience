# Preparing for content authors

Before content authors can create content you must prepare your site to be ready for content creation, including preparing the site toolbar, enabling inline editing, and creating templates.


-   **[Adding content: Site Toolbar or Site Manager](site_toolbar_or_manager.md)**  
When adding content to a site in edit mode, a content author has the choice of using either the Site Toolbar or Site Manager. Site developers need to consider which option is best for their content authors.
-   **[Generate author-ready templates](wcm_dev_content_types.md)**  
You can generate author-ready templates in Web Content Manager to provide content authors a set of predefined content templates that can be selected from the toolbar and used to add content to a page.
-   **[Page components](../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/authoring_portlet/content_management_artifacts/pages/page_components/index.md)**  
Create page components by using Web Content Manager to provide content authors a set of predefined page components that can be selected from the toolbar and added to a page.
-   **[Enabling and disabling segments in the Add Segments view](contarget_enable_disable_segments.md)**  
You can customize the Add Segments view so that you see only segments, only managed segments, or both segments and managed segments.
-   **[Preparing the site toolbar](../site_prep_content_author/prep_site_toolbar/index.md)**  
The site toolbar enables content authors to work with content from the website instead of using the authoring portlet. Customize the site toolbars to improve the authoring experience for content authors.
-   **[Creating custom icons for the Page Components palette and Web content authoring interface](../site_prep_content_author/custom_icons_page_cmpnt_palette/index.md)**  
You can assign a custom image to an item type in the Page Components palette and Web content authoring interface. You can either use a single image or a collection of images that are bundled into a ZIP file, called multi-scale icons. Supported image file formats are PNG, JPG, and SVG. If you are using multi-scale icons, the collection of images must be compressed into a ZIP file. No other format is supported. You can add custom images by either adding a file element directly into the content, or by creating a reference to a file component.
-   **[Customizing site manager](../site_prep_content_author/custom_site_manager/index.md)**  
You can configure site manager by setting portlet preferences for the site manager portlet in Manage Portlets.
-   **[Creating project templates](site_project_temps.md)**  
Projects help content authors group and manage changes across the website. As a site administrator, you can create templates for your authors to use.
-   **[Customizing the Web Content Authoring portlet](../../../manage_content/wcm_authoring/authoring_portlet/auth_portlet_settings/wcm_cms_authoring_portlet_custom.md)**  
To customize each Web Content Authoring portlet for the people who use that portlet, you can edit the shared settings of each Web Content Authoring portlet on your authoring system.
