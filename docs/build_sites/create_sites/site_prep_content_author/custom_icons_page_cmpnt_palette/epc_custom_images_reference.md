# Creating custom icons by referencing a file component

You can create custom images for items in the Page Components palette and Web content authoring interface by deploying the image file or multi-scale ZIP file as a file component in a library. Then, put a component reference element into your item that refers to that file component.

!!! note
    In CF09, the Content palette was renamed to Page Components palette, and the custom images feature was extended to the Web content authoring interface.

-   Supported image file formats are PNG, JPG, and SVG.
-   If you are using multi-scale icons, the collection of images must be compressed into a ZIP file.

1.  Click the **Applications** menu icon in the site toolbar.

2.  Click **Content** \> **Web Content Authoring**.

3.  Navigate to the library where you want to store the image as a file component.

4.  Click **New** \> **Component** \> **File**.

5.  Enter a unique name for the new component.

    For example, my\_icon.

6.  Upload the file and click **Save and Close**.

7.  To assign a custom image to a content item or a site area, select the content item and click **Edit**.

    -   You can also do the same in a content template or site area template to make this field available to content authors.

8.  Click the **More** menu.

9.  Click **Manage Elements**.

10. In the **Element type** dropdown menu, select **Component Reference**.

11. In the **Name** field, specify the name of the new element as preview-image.

12. Click **Add**.

13. Click **OK** to exit the Element Manager window.

14. Click **Select Component** for the my\_icon component reference.

    The Select a component window displays.

15. Navigate to the library where you saved the my\_icon component reference.

16. Select the **my\_icon** file component.

    -   Any content items, including items created prior to CF09, that include an element named preview-image will use the images stored in the selected component as the icon of the content item in the Web content authoring interface.
