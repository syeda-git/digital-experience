# Creating custom icons by adding an image element

You can create custom images for items in the Page Components palette and Web content authoring interface by deploying the image file directly into the item in the Page Components palette or Web content authoring interface as an element.

!!! note 
    In CF09, the Content palette was renamed to Page Components palette, and the custom images feature was extended to the Web content authoring interface.

-   Supported image file formats are PNG, JPG, and SVG.

1.  Click the **Applications** menu icon in the site toolbar.

2.  Click **Content** \> **Web Content Authoring**.

3.  To assign a custom image to a content item or a site area, select the item and click **Edit**.

    -   You can also do the same in a content template or site area template to make this field available to content authors.

4.  Click the **More** menu.

5.  Click **Manage Elements**.

6.  In the **Element type** dropdown menu, select **Image**.

7.  In the **Name** field, specify the name of the new element as preview-image.

    -   Any content items, including items created prior to CF09, that include an element named preview-image will use the image stored in this element as the icon of the content item in the Web content authoring interface.
    
8.  Click **Add**.

9.  Click **OK** to exit the Element Manager window.
