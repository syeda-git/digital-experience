# Prerequisites

This guide assumes a general understanding of web application security.

Web application security is:

- Fundamental [information security](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/infosecuritybasics.pdf) concepts,

- Considered from the perspective of a [web application](https://www.cisa.gov/security-publications/website-security),

- Integrated into a comprehensive security plan via [risk management](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf).

Web applications are commonly the primary interface by which end users access information. Few are entirely self-contained, but are distinct components of broader, integrated information systems.

Such integrated components comprise a trust chain. Longer trust chains require greater effort to secure. However, the trust boundaries which exist between components can help improve security by providing defense-in-depth – hardening each component can limit the scope and likelihood of any attack.

Each section in this guide introduces a common security requirement for, or security functionality of, HCL Digital Experience. Each section includes a Recommended actions and considerations section to guide you through evaluating and improving the security footing of your application.

Following this guide could require a months-long or open-ended project involving multiple teams that should result in an application-specific security hardening procedure that spans development, deployment, and maintenance. Regularly review this Security Hardening Guide for HCL Digital Experience for updates.

## Recommended actions and considerations

Independently research web application security to identify other resources to inform your evaluation. Especially consider:
