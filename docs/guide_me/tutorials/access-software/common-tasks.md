From the List Entitlements page, you can have an overview of the entitlements your organization has. You also have the option to export all or selected entitlements into a spreadsheet.

You can open each entitlement by clicking the Activation ID links and view more details such as the ID, Product, and Activation Info. Make sure the Product name, quantity, and expiration date are correct. If you have a maintenance for an entitlement, check the Expiration Date under the Maintenance Info instead.
