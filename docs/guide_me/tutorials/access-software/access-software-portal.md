# How to Access HCL Software License & Delivery Portal

As this is a guide on how to download DX products, we are going to mainly focus on accessing the HCL Software License & Delivery Portal.

After you register and with the existence of entitlements, you should automatically receive an email with your credentials.

If you do not have a username and password for the license portal, make sure that you have gone through the steps discussed in [How to register to HCL Software portals](register-for-access.md) or you have already been added by your Admin thru this process [Adding Users](common-tasks.md#adding-users).

Should you lose these credentials, you can follow the steps detailed in [How to reset your password on HCL License & Delivery Portal (KB0073419)](https://HCLSoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/logon.do) to reset your password.
