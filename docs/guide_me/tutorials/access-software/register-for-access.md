# How to Register for Access

This guide describes a comprehensive procedure to successfully Register and Access the HCL Software License & Delivery site, Locate and Download DX products and steps on how to open a support ticket in case you encounter any issue with getting the software.

Outlined in here are the steps that need to be taken if you are a HCL Customer or a Business Partner.

## Introduction to HCL License & Delivery Portal

The license portal provides both Software distribution and management of your Software entitlements purchased from [HCL Software](https://www.hcltechsw.com/). The portal provides you with control and flexibility on how to consume your licenses. Typically, an organization will have someone identified as a License Manager (also called Tech or Portal Admin) that has familiarity with the language of Licenses and you may wish to add them as a user. If not, you should find these instructions sufficient to begin using your HCL software.

## How to Register to HCL Software Portals
  
HCL Software has 3 main sites that require separate login. As we are working towards Single Sign On for the different sites, but have not yet implemented this, currently each site has a separate login.

* The [E-commerce site](https://buy.hcltechsw.com/) for Software Contract Renewals.
* The [License & Delivery site](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/logon.do) for managing Software Licenses and providing you with Software Downloads.
* The [Customer Support site](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm) for working with HCL Support on Support Cases.

Indicated below are the steps on how to register as an HCL Customer or as an HCL Business Partner.
