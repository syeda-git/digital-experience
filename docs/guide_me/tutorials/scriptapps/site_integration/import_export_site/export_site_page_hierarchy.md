    (node:86263) Warning: Setting the NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED environment variable to '0' makes TLS connections and HTTPS requests insecure by disabling certificate verification.

    ```

## Output

Find in your base directory the xml output in store/outputFiles/xmlaccess (The zip output file should look something like this: `Output-20220926095803.xml`). Move the exported zip to a different directory to ensure it would not be lost.
