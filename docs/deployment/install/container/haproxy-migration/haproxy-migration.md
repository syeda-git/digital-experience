# Migrate from Ambassador to HAProxy

Starting with CF203, the Ambassador Ingress controller was deprecated, and is removed in CF204. Please refer to CF203 for the option of testing Ambassador and HAProxy side-by-side before migrating. When upgrading to CF204 and later, Ambassador is removed and replaced by HAProxy.
