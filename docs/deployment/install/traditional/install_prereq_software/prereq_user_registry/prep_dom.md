    1.  Go to the **People** view of the Domino Directory and then click **Add Person**.

    2.  Enter the following values in the **New Person** form to create the LDAP bind user. The following example uses wpsbind to represent the LDAP bind user:

        -   ****Last Name****

            wpsbind

        -   ****User name****

            wpsbind/DominoDomain, where DominoDomain is your Domino® Internet domain.

            wpsbind

            **Note:** Make sure that you enter two values in the **User Name** field, where the first value includes the Domino® domain.

        -   ****Short name/UserID****

            wpsbind

        -   ****Internet password****

            wpsbind

    3.  Click **Save and Close** to save the new person record for wpsbind and return to the **People** view.

    4.  Click **Add Person** and enter the following values in the **New Person** form to create the Portal administration user. The following example uses wpsadmin to represent the Portal administration user:

        -   ****Last Name****

            wpsadmin, where wpsadmin is the user ID for the HCL Administrator.

        -   ****User name****

            wpsadmin/DominoDomain, where DominoDomain is your Domino® Internet domain.

            wpsadmin

            **Note:** Make sure that you enter two values in the **User Name** field, where the first value includes the Domino® domain.

        -   ****Short name/UserID****

            wpsadmin

        -   ****Internet password****

            wpsadmin

    5.  Click **Save and Close** to save the new person record for wpsadmin and return to the **People** view.

    6.  Go to the **Groups** view and click **Add Group**.

    7.  Enter the following values in the **New Group** form on the Basic tab:

        -   ****Group name****

            wpsadmins

            **Note:** If your Domino® LDAP shares a realm with another user registry, you must use the hierarchical naming convention for the group names. Enter wpsadmins/DominoDomain to avoid unexpected results during HCL Portal run time.

        -   ****Group type****

            Multi-purpose

        -   ****Members****

            wpsbind/DominoDomain

            wpsadmin/DominoDomain

            **Note:** You can add more administrator users.

    1.  Open the names.nsf file in the Domino Administrator or HCL Notes client.

    2.  Click **File** \> **Application** \> **Access Control** from the main menu to open the access control list for the file.

    3.  In the **Access Control List** \> **Basics** panel, ensure that the wpsadmins group has either Author or Editor access.

    4.  Add the following **Role Types** to the wpsadmins group:
