# Installing HCL Digital Experience in AIX system using the console

Use the IBM Installation Manager to install HCL Digital Experience to an existing IBM WebSphere Application Server.

A working installation of IBM® WebSphere® Application Server is required. Ensure that it is not used by another copy of HCL Portal. Before you install the HCL Portal package, install **IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition** into the same directory where IBM WebSphere Application Server is installed. The SDK Java version must be 7.0.

The installation program verifies the operating system and its prerequisites, available disk space, and any required software prerequisites before installation. You cannot install two instances of the server at the same time, even if you are installing to different directories. You must install each server completely before you install the next one.

## Procedure

1.  Start all servers and applications that require a port number to avoid port conflicts when you install HCL Portal. If you are installing multiple copies of HCL Digital Experience on your server, start the existing Configuration Wizard servers.

    !!!note
        Currently, the cw_profile starting point always defaults to 10200. If you install a second version of portal on the same server, you must customize the cw_profile port value. Add the following line to the InstallationManager_root/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools/imcl.ini file: `-Dcwprofile_startingport=new_starting_port_number

2.  Complete the following steps to run the program as an administrator:

    1.  Go to the InstallationManager_root/eclipse/tools directory.

    2.  Right-click on the imcl command.

    3.  Select **Properties**.

    4.  Go to the **Compatibility** tab.

    5.  Select **Run this program as an administrator**.

    6.  Click **OK**.

3.  Open a command prompt and change to the InstallationManager_root/eclipse/tools directory.

4.  Run the command to start the IBM Installation Manager in console mode:

    `./imcl -c`

    `imcl -c`

    `imcl -c`

5.  Complete the following steps to add the repositories:

    1.  Enter P to go to the **Preferences** menu.

    2.  Enter 1 to go to the **Repositories** menu.
