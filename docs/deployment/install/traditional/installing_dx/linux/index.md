# Preparing your Linux system for installation

Installing includes preparing your operating system, installing HCL Portal and HCL Web Content Manager, and completing the deployment configuration.

Before you begin

Roadmaps for installation and deployment are included in this product documentation to guide you through the process. Roadmaps provide a high-level overview of the process from beginning to end. See [Roadmaps to deploy your system](../../../../../get_started/plan_deployment/traditional_deployment/roadmaps/index.md) for more information.

Then, use the Configuration Wizard to complete the deployment configuration. See [Configuration Wizard](../../../../manage/portal_admin_tools/cfg_wizard/index.md) in our product base documentation to learn more about using the tool.
