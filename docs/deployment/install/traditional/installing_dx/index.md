# Installing the HCL Digital Experience software

The HCL Digital Experience is designed to help create, manage, simplify, and integrate your processes into an engaging online experience.

Prerequisites
-   [Planning to install HCL Digital Experience](../../../../get_started/plan_deployment/traditional_deployment/index.md)

Select a roadmap to guide you through the installation and deployment process. The installation process uses IBMÂ® Installation Manager to install the digital experience. Select your operating system to get started. After you complete the installation, you have a functional portal, unless you selected to install only the binaries for a migration path. Then, use the Configuration Wizard to complete the deployment.

Existing users need to be on one-level previous version of HCL Digital Experience with applicable software fixes before installing Version 9.5 on top of it. See [Supported migration paths](../../../../deployment/manage/migrate/planning_migration/mig_plan_supported_paths.md) for more information.
