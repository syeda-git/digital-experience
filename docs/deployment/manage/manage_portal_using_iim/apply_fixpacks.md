# Using the Installation Manager to install fixes

Periodically fix packs are released to integrate product code fixes. Between fix pack releases, interim fixes might be recommended or required to ensure product reliability and stability. The Recommended fixes page provides links to fix pack and interim fix downloads, information about what is recommended and what is required, and links to recommended related product fixes. To find the most current service update information, see the Recommended fixes link.

Use the IBMÂ® Installation Manager update function to update the product files.

CAUTION:

The information in these files is basic instruction. Before you change your system settings, review all readme files that are included with your fixes for complete instructions.

1.  Start the Installation Manager.

2.  Add the repository that contains the interim fix.

3.  Test the repository connection and provide authentication credentials, if necessary, to access the directory where the repositories are stored.

4.  Select **Update** to install the fix.

5.  After you review the summary information, run the process to install the fix.

6.  After you install the interim fix, review all readme files that are included with your fixes for additional instructions.
