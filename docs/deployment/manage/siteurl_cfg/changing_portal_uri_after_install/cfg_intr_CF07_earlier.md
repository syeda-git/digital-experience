# CF07 and earlier: Changing the portal URI after an installation

You can change the default portal Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) any time after you install HCL Digital Experience. Some applications have a fixed context root that cannot be changed.

If you are on Combined Cumulative Fix 8, go to [Changing the portal URI after an installation](index.md).

HCL Digital Experience and Web Services for Remote Portlets are installed with a default URI. You can change this URI after installation to better suit the requirements of your organization.

!!!note "Notes"
-   To change the HCL DX URI: When you specify the context root, do not specify a value that is the same as a directory that exists in a portlet WAR directory. For example, you set the HCL DX context root to /images. There is a portlet with the directory structure /myPortlet.ear/myPortlet.war/images. This issue might cause a conflict if the portlet encodes URI references to resources in its own /images directory. In this situation, the portlet would be unable to display images. HCL DX looks for the image resources according to its own context root path instead of the directory path that is specified by the portlet WAR file.
-   For changing the URI of a WSRP Producer portal: Changing the WSRP Producer context root does not require that you redeploy all portlets. Run the modify-servlet-path configuration task only.

!!!important
    With Version 8, the URI of the context root for the WSRP Producer is `/wps/wsrp`. Before Version 8, this context root was `/wsrp`. If you migrated from an earlier version, you still might have WSRP Consumers that attempt to access the WSRP Producer with the previous context root \(`/wsrp`\). You can correct this issue in one of the following ways:

    -   Modify the context root for the WSRP Producer to `/wsrp`. This change enables the Consumers to access the Producer without requiring further changes to the Consumers.
    -   Update the configuration of the WSRP Consumers to use the new context root \(`/wps/wsrp`\).
-   If you use HCL Web Content Manager Syndication, the Syndicators and Subscribers servers that refer to this Portal instance must be updated with the modified URI. Log on to the HCL DX syndicating to this instance. Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal Content > Syndicators**. Click the edit icon of the Syndicator you want to edit. Update the URL with the new context root information. Then, log on to the HCL DX subscribing to this instance. Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal Content > Subscribers**. Click the edit icon of the subscriber you want to edit. Update the URL with the new context root information.

!!!note "Cluster note"
    If you modify the URI in a clustered environment, complete the steps that are described here on the primary node only, except where specified differently. Also, verify that AutoSynch is set to a frequency of 1 minute.

1.  Complete the following steps to manually modify the HCL DX context root:

    1.  Stop the WebSphere_Portal server.

    2.  Locate the wkplc.properties and wkplc_comp.properties files in the wp_profile_root/ConfigEngine/properties directory and create backup copies before you change any values.

    3.  Use a text editor to open the wkplc.properties file and enter the appropriate value for your environment in the WpsContextRoot property.

    4.  Save and close the file.

    5.  Use a text editor to open the wkplc_comp.properties file and enter the appropriate value for your environment in the following properties:

        -   WsrpContextRoot
        -   WpsPersonalizedHome
        -   WpsDefaultHome
        
        !!!attention
            Do not enter the same value for WpsPersonalizedHome and WpsDefaultHome.

    6.  Save and close the file.

    7.  Start the WebSphere_Portal server in a stand-alone environment or the deployment manager and node agent in a clustered environment.

    8.  Open a command prompt and change to the wp_profile_root/ConfigEngine directory.

    9.  Complete the following steps to change the HCL DX URI:

        1.  To change the context root for the values that you entered in the WpsContextRoot, WsrpContextRoot, WpsPersonalizedHome, and or WpsDefaultHome properties, run the following task:

        In a clustered environment, complete these steps on the primary node only.

    1.  Stop the WebSphere_Portal server.

    2.  Back up the database.

    3.  Prior to CF04, start the WebSphere_Portal server. Starting with CF04, do not restart the WebSphere_Portal server.

    4.  Complete the following steps to unregister the node types:

        -   Open the ibmcontentwcm.registernodetypes file, which is in the /WebSphere/PortalServer/wcm/prereq.wcm/config/nodetypes/ directory.
        -   Change <registerAction action="register"/> to <registerAction action="deregister"/>.
        -   Save your changes.
        -   Run the following task:
            -   AIX and Linux: `./ConfigEngine.sh action-register-wcm-nodetypes -DWasPassword=password -DPortalAdminPwd=password`
            -   Windows: `ConfigEngine.bat action-register-wcm-nodetypes -DWasPassword=password -DPortalAdminPwd=password`
rd
    5.  Complete the following steps to register the node types:

        -   Open the ibmcontentwcm.registernodetypes file, which is in the /WebSphere/PortalServer/wcm/prereq.wcm/config/nodetypes/ directory.
        -   Change <registerAction action="deregister"/> to <registerAction action="register"/>.
        -   Update all lines that contain the <ApplicationURI name="wps/mypoc/?view=auth&uri=wcm:oid:"/\> content.

            Change the name of the attribute value to reflect the new WpsContextRoot value that is found in the wkplc.properties file. For example, if the original value for WpsContextRoot was wps and the new value is wp8, change the lines to <ApplicationURI name="wp8/mypoc/?view=auth&uri=wcm:oid:"/\>.

        -   Run the following task:
            -   AIX and Linux: `./ConfigEngine.sh action-register-wcm-nodetypes -DWasPassword=password -DPortalAdminPwd=password`
            -   Windows: `ConfigEngine.bat action-register-wcm-nodetypes -DWasPassword=password -DPortalAdminPwd=password`

    6.  Run the following SQL query to verify that the entries in the table now show the new URI:

        ```
        select * from JCR.ICMSTJCRNODEREGISTER
        ```

    7.  Restart the WebSphere\_Portal server.

6.  Required if you use HCL Web Content Manager: Complete the following steps to manually change the JSP components in the Web Resources v70 Library:

    !!!note "Cluster note"
        In a clustered environment, complete these steps on the primary node only.

    1.  Log on to HCL DX.

    2.  Go to **Applications > Content > Web Content Authoring**.

    3.  Under **Preferences**, select **Edit Shared Settings**.

    4.  Under **Library Selection**, add **Web Resources v70** to the **Selected Libraries** list.

    5.  Click **OK**.

    6.  Under **Item Views**, select **All Items > All > Components > JSP**.

    7.  Select every **JSP component** from the Web Resources v70 library and then click **Edit**.

    8.  Update the **Path** field for every JSP component with the new context root path.

        The JSP path includes two parts, which are separated by a semi-colon. The first part is the context path to the HCL Web Content Manager extensions web application and then the second part is the path to the JSP. Update the path to the web application.

        For example, the other path might be: /wcmextension;/jsp/html/general/UpdateItem.jsp. If you changed the context root to mynewcontext, change the old path to /mynewcontext/wcmextension;/jsp/html/general/UpdateItem.jsp.

7.  Update your custom themes to reference the correct Dojo context root.

    The default Dojo context root in HCL DX is /wps/portal_dojo. After you run the modify-servlet-path and modify-servlet-path-portlets tasks, the Dojo context root is changed to include the new value in the WpsContextRoot parameter as the prefix. For instance, if the new WpsContextRoot value is myco, then the new Dojo context root becomes /myco/portal_dojo. If your theme includes hardcoded references to "/wps/portal_dojo", update those references to the new context root. If you migrated a custom theme, you might find that it has references to /portal_dojo without the /wps prefix. Look for these references in both the WAR file and in the WebDAV storage for your theme.

    !!!note
        In a clustered environment, complete these steps on the primary node only.

8.  Complete the following steps to edit the context root for every search collection:

    !!!attention
        Edit the context root for each existing search collection.

    1.  Log on to HCL DX as the administrator.

    2.  To open the **Manage Search** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Search Administration > Manage Search**.

    3.  Click **Search Collections**.

    4.  Click the search collection that you want to update.

        For example: **Default Search Collection**.

    5.  Click the **Edit Content Source** icon for the first content source in the list.

    6.  Edit the URL listed in the **Collect documents link from the URL** with the new context root.

    7.  Click **Save**.

    8.  Edit the URL in each remaining content source and then save your changes.

    9.  Start the HCL DX crawler content source for each collection:

        -   If the documents are not stored in the search collection but a schedule is defined for the crawler, the crawler automatically runs at the scheduled time. You can also start the crawler manually.
        -   If the documents are already collected, select **Regather documents** to update the documents with the new context root information.

    10. Click **Collections from All Services** in the breadcrumb trail and select the next search collection to modify.

9.  Complete the following steps if you changed the context root and you have existing search scopes:

    1.  To open the **Manage Search** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Search Administration > Manage Search**. Then, click **Search Scopes**.

    2.  Delete the following search scopes:

        -   **All Sources**
        -   **Managed Web Content**

    3.  Restart the portal server to re-create the search scopes with the correct context.

10. Complete the following steps to change the context root for the **Seedlist_Servlet**:

    1.  Log in to the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console.

    2.  Go to **Applications > Application Types > WebSphere enterprise applications**.

    3.  Click the **Seedlist_Servlet** application link.
