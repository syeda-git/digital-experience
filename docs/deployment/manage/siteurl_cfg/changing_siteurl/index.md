# Changing the site URL after an installation

After you install HCL Digital Experience, you can change the portal site URL to create a shorter or more human-readable URL. Use the new option in the Configuration Wizard to remove or change the context root and default home (/wps/portal) values in your site URL. You can also select an option to remove or add navigational state information from your site URL.

For example, you can use the Configuration Wizard to change the site URL as follows:

http://www.example.com:port/wps/portal/products/\[!ut/p/encoded\_portal\_suffix\] to

http://www.example.com:port/products/

!!!note "Limitation"
    If you removed the context root, the HCL Web Content Manager Commerce Integration linking and editing function does not work.

!!!note "Notes"
    -   HCL Portal and Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) are installed with a default context root that you can change in the Configuration Wizard. Some applications have a fixed context root that cannot be changed.
    -   If you use Web Application Bridge, you cannot remove the context root from your site URL. Use the Configuration Wizard to modify the context root and default home values in your site URLs or to remove the default home value from your site URL.
    -   You can use this option for stand-alone and clustered environments. For clustered environments, you can use this option only on the primary node.
