# Install fix packs on the source environment

Periodically fix packs are released to integrate product code fixes. Between fix pack releases, there are interim fixes to ensure product reliability and stability. You must apply the latest cumulative fix to the source environment. The Recommended fixes link provides links to fix pack and interim fix downloads. There is also information about what is recommended and what is required.
