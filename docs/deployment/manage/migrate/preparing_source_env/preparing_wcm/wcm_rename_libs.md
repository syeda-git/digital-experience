# Renaming web content libraries

If the name of a web content library is the same as the URL context of a virtual portal, you can experience incorrect rendering behavior. To prevent this issue, rename the library to a different name before you start the migration.

1.  Log in to HCL Digital Experience.

2.  Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal Content** \> **Web Content Libraries**.

3.  For the library that you want to rename, click the **Edit Library** icon.

4.  Enter a new name for the library that is distinct from the URL context of the virtual portal.
