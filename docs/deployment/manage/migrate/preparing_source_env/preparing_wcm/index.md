# Preparing Web Content Manager content

To migrate HCL Web Content Manager data, you must remove the locks on content and rename the content libraries.

-   **[Removing locks](wcm_remove_locks.md)**  
Before migrating, it is recommended that locks are removed on Web content items.
-   **[Renaming web content libraries](wcm_rename_libs.md)**  
If the name of a web content library is the same as the URL context of a virtual portal, you can experience incorrect rendering behavior. To prevent this issue, rename the library to a different name before you start the migration.
-   **[Preventing items from being expired during migration](mig_content_options_further.md)**  
By default, items with no expiration date defined are automatically expired. Change this setting to prevent automatic expiration from occurring.
