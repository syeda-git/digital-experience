# Site toolbar

During migration, the HCL Digital Experience 8.5 theme is deployed. The 8.5 theme includes the site toolbar, but the toolbar is enabled only for the default virtual portal. For all other virtual portals, you must install the site toolbar separately.

The site toolbar contains artifacts that are not scoped to virtual portals. The global menus, such as the site menu, applications menu, and the administration menu, are displayed in virtual portals. However, the full site toolbar menu options, such as opening the toolbar, the project selector, as well as the edit mode switch, are hidden. To enable the full site toolbar, you must install and enable the toolbar for the respective virtual portal.
