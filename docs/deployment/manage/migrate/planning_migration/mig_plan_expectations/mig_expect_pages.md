# Page order

If the page order was altered for HCL pages in the Applications, Administration, or Hidden Pages areas on your source environment, then the page order might not be correct on the target environment after migration.

You can adjust the page order of your pages using the Portal Administration menu or XMLAccess. If you want your pages to be listed first, then ensure that they have ordinal values less than 100. For more information, see the post-migration step for [Updating page order](../../../../../deployment/manage/migrate/next_steps/post_mig_activities/portal_task/mig_post_update_page_order.md).
