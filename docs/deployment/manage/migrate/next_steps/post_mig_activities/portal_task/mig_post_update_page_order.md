# Updating page order

If the page order was altered for HCL Digital Experience pages in the Applications, Administration, or Hidden Pages areas on your source environment, then the page order might not be correct on the target environment after migration.

You can adjust the page order of your pages using the Portal Administration menu or XMLAccess. If you want your pages to be listed first, then ensure that they have ordinal values less than 100. For more information about using XMLAccess to edit the ordinal values for your pages, see *XMLAccess Frequently Asked Questions* at [HCL Software Support](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm).

1.  Click **Administration**.

2.  Click **Manage Pages**.

3.  Use the **Move up** and **Move down** icons to adjust the order of your pages.

    !!!note
        If you are rearranging the tree structure of your pages, then you can use the **Mark** icon to mark the page, and then move it.
