# Updating a WSRP Producer

After you complete the migration of your data, perform the following task if you use HCL Digital Experience as a WSRP Producer.

-   The WSRP web service security configuration of a Producer is not automatically migrated. After you complete the migration of a Producer portal, you must manually configure the WSRP Producer for security. For more information, see *Securing a WSRP Producer portal*.

    !!!note
        HCL Digital Experience does not provide a default option for the configuration of web service security that uses signed user name tokens anymore. If you have used this security configuration on earlier versions of HCL Digital Experience, see *Security for WSRP services* for available security options for WSRP.
