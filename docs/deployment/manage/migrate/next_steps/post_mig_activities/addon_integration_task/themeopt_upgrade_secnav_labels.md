# Navigation with consecutive labels is dynamic

The secondary navigation is dynamic, and shows only two levels of navigation at a time. When a page on the last level of navigation is selected, only that level of navigation is displayed. It is possible to select a page where both the parent level of navigation and the grandparent level of navigation are both labels. In this case, the sibling navigation for the parent level is not accessible.
