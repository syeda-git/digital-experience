# Installing fix packs on the target environment

Periodically, fix packs are released to integrate product code fixes. Between fix pack releases, there are interim fixes to ensure product reliability and stability. You must apply the latest available fix pack and cumulative fix to the target environment. The Recommended fixes link provides links to fix pack and interim fix downloads. There is also information about what is recommended and what is required.
