# Using the DB2 Backup Wizard

Use the Backup wizard of IBM DB2 Universal Database Enterprise Server Edition to create online or offline backups. This sample scenario describes how to create a full offline backup of an HCL Portal database.

Before you perform an offline backup, stop all services that access the DB2Â® database: WPSDB, which is the default database for the Release database domain.

To perform a full offline backup of the WPSDB database, follow these steps:

1.  Stop the servers.

2.  Open the DB2 Control Center: Click **General Administration Tools** \> **Control Center**.

3.  To open the Backup wizard, expand the object tree until you find the WPSDB database, display its menu, and select **Backup**.

4.  After confirming that the details of your database are correct, click **Next**.

5.  Select a storage location for the backup and click **Next**.

6.  Select the backup type **Full backup** and an availability of **Offline**.

7.  Unless you have configured a separate task to quiesce the database, select **Quiesce** to ensure that all users are disconnected from the database before the backup task begins.

8.  Click **Next**.

9.  If you are experiencing performance problems during backups, skip the next step and go to Step 11.

10. At Specify performance options for the backup, click **Next** to choose one of the following options:

    -   To specify a schedule for the backup task, click **Change** and click **Next**.

        !!!important
            Select a time when no users are working with the database or with applications that might be running on the server.

    -   To perform a backup without setting a schedule, click **Run now without saving task history** and click **Next**.
    
11. Click **Show Command** to view the DB2 commands that the Backup wizard runs.

    !!!note "Tip"
        You can copy these commands to use in the Task Center as an alternative to using the Backup wizard the next time you want to back up the database.

    !!!note
        The following example includes line breaks for readability. In actual practice, you need to type all commands, including the semicolons, on one line.

    ```
    CONNECT TO WPSDB;QUIESCE DATABASE IMMEDIATE FORCE CONNECTIONS;CONNECT RESET;
    BACKUP DATABASE WPSDB TO "D:\BackupFiles\DB2backup\" WITH 2 BUFFERS 
    BUFFER 1024 PARALLELISM 1 WITHOUT PROMPTING;CONNECT TO WPSDB;
    UNQUIESCE DATABASE;CONNECT RESET;
    
    ```

12. When you are satisfied with your settings for the database backup, click **Finish** to start the backup task.

DB2 displays a message confirming that the backup task has completed successfully or that the task encountered and logged problems that need to be fixed.
