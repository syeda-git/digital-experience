# Setting the portal entry page

Use the Global Settings portlet to specify the page that a user sees when the user logs in to HCL Digital Experience.

!!!note
    The Global Settings portlet does not work in portal cluster configurations.

1.  Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal Settings > Global Settings**.

2.  Make a selection from the field **When a user logs in, the first page displayed**:

    -   **Will always be the user's default page (portal session will not resume)**

        Choose this option if you want users to always return to the default page after login.

    -   **Will be the page the user most recently visited (portal session will resume)**

        Choose this option if you want users to return to the page from their last visit. This option is helpful when users lose their portal session in the middle of a task and need to login to return.

    -   **Will be dependent upon the choice the user makes at login**

        Choose this option to let users determine the initial view by their choice after login.

3.  Click **Save**.

If you have a portal cluster configuration, use the WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console to set the properties `persistent.session.level` and `persistent.session.option` in the portal configuration service. For more information, refer to the topics about *Configuring user session persistence*, *Portal configuration services, and* *Setting service configuration properties*.
