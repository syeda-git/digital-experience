# Enabling portlet filtering

You enable the usage of portlet filters by setting the legacy.portlet.enable.filtering property in the Portlet Container Service.

To enable portlet filtering for the portal, set this property value to true:

```
legacy.portlet.enable.filtering = true
```

The default value is true.

For more details see the topic about the *Portlet Container Service*. For details about setting the property see the topic about *Setting service configuration properties*.
