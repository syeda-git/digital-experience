# Configuring your time settings

Some applications, like Calendar, are capable of adapting to the time zone settings of a user.

By default, this functionality is disabled. If you want to enable your system to adjust to your local time settings, you must add a mapping to the ibm-timeZone attribute. See Adapting the Attribute Configuration topic in the Installing section in the Configuring portal to use a user registry topic.
