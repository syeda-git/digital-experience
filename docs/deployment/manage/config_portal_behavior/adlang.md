# Setting the language of the portal

Specify the default language in which the portal appears with the Global Settings portlet.

!!!note
    The Global Settings portlet does not work in portal cluster configurations. For portal clusters set the portal default language in the portal Localizer service by using the WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console. For details about how to set the language see *Setting service configuration properties*.

1.  Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal Settings > Global Settings**.

2.  Select the language for the portal from the **Default portal language** list.

3.  Click **Save**.


For a list of the languages that are supported by the portal, see *Language support*.
