# Enabling client side logging and tracing

Modify the custom properties cc.isDebug and cc.traceConfig in the WP CommonComponentConfigService to enable client-side logging and tracing.

1.  Access the WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console.

2.  Go to **Resources** \> **Resource environment** \> **Resource environment providers** \> **WP CommonComponentConfigService**.

3.  To view and edit the custom properties for this resource environment provider, click the **Custom Properties** link.

4.  Set the value of the property `cc.isDebug` to true.

5.  Set the value of the property `cc.traceConfig` property to a value that represents a correctly formatted JavaScript array of strings. Each string in the array is the name of the component that you want to trace. You can use the wildcard character asterisk \(`**\***`\) for multiple matching.

    Example:

    ```
    ["com.ibm.mashups.enabler.*","com.ibm.mashups.builder.model.ContextMenu"]
    ```

    This value adds client-side trace-logging for all components in the namespace `com.ibm.mashups.enabler` and the component `com.ibm.mashups.builder.model.ContextMenu`.

6.  Save and persist the changes to the master configuration.

7.  Restart the portal server.


Examples: To activate all iWidget related logging and tracing, you use the following line:

```
traceConfig: ["com.ibm.mm.iwidget.*"]
```

To set multiple patterns, you separate them by commas like this example:

```
traceConfig: ["com.ibm.mm.iwidget.*", "com.ibm.portal.*", "com.ibm.portal.wps.*"]
```

By alternative, you can also achieve the same result by using scripting tools that WebSphere Application Server provides. For more information, refer to the WebSphere Application Server Help Center under topic *configuring custom properties for resource environment providers by using wsadmin scripting*.
