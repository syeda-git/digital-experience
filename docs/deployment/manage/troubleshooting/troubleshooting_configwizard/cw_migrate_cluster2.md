# Troubleshooting: Migrate node profiles for a cluster environment

If you encounter a failure during the migration of the node profiles for a cluster environment, learn how to correct the issue and recover from the failure.

Each potential step in the migrate node profiles option is included. Since the steps vary, depending on your selections, the steps are not numbered. Find the step that failed to learn more about correcting and recovering from the failure.
