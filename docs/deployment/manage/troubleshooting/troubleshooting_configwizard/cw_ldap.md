# Troubleshooting: Enable federated security option

Enabling federated security is part of many environment setups. If you encounter a failure during the configuration process, determine whether you can run the step again, skip the step, or if you must clean up the step. For some failed steps, learn how to correct the issue and recover from the failure.

Each potential step in the configuration is included. Because the steps vary depending on your selections, the steps are not numbered. Find the step that failed to learn more about correcting and recovering from the failure. If you need to change a value that you entered in the wizard, then you must run the configuration again.

!!!note
    If you must go through the wizard again, download the wizard selections that you made to save time. Then, cancel the configuration. Start the process over and upload your saved selections. Correct or enter values for the parameters that caused the failure.

!!!attention
    The Enable Federated Security option modifies the wimconfig.xml file. Make a backup copy of this file before you run any of the configuration tasks.<br> `wp_profile_root/config/cells/CellName/wim/config/wimconfig.xml`

# Validate your LDAP server settings

During this step, the wizard attempts to connect to your LDAP server and authenticate by using the provided credentials and LDAP information.

1.  Verify that the values used to connect with the LDAP were entered correctly. Click **View Step Command** to see which values are used.


# Add an LDAP user registry to the default federated repository

During this step, the wizard attempts to add your LDAP to the federated repository. This step uses the same parameters as the step that validates the LDAP server settings.

|Run step again|You can run the step repeatedly without causing any harm.|
|Skip step|If this step is successful, you can skip it if you run the configuration process again.|
|Clean up step|Complete the following steps from the WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console to remove the configured repository: <br> 1.  Go to **Security > Global Security > Configure**.<br> 2.  Remove the repository from the realm.<br>3.  Go to **Manage repositories** and delete the repository configuration.|

# Register the WebSphere Application Server scheduler tasks

|Actions|Notes|

|Run step again|You can run this step again after you clean up the issue.|
|Skip step|If this step is successful, you can skip it if you run the configuration process again.|
|Clean up step|Log in to the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console. Go to **Resources > Schedulers** and delete the **WPSTaskScheduler**. If this task fails because of the administrator ID, change the `federated.ldap.bindDN` and optionally the newAdminId value. These values must be unique. Then, rerun this task. If this action does not resolve the issue, run the `wp-change-portal-admin-user and wp-change-was-admin-user` tasks. These tasks change the PortalAdminId and WasUserId so that the file system administrators are different from the LDAP users.|

# Replace the file-based HCL Portal and WebSphere Application Server users and groups with users and groups from your LDAP server

During this step, the wizard attempts to configure the portal to use the administrative user and user group that is stored in your LDAP server. The administrative ID and group must exist in your LDAP server. If the ID and group do not exist, create them and try the step again.

|Run step again|You can run the step repeatedly without causing any harm.|
|Skip step|If this step is successful, you can skip it if you run the configuration process again.|
|Clean up step|You can log in to the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console. However, the portal administrative user does not work as expected. You do not need to deactivate security with the file-based repository.If the WebSphere Application Server administrative user is not functional, it is likely that the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console is not accessible. If you cannot log in to the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console, disable security in the security.xml file in the wp_profile_root/config/cells/cellname directory. Restart WebSphere Application Server and log in. Then, complete the following steps: <br> 1.  Go to **Users and Groups > Administrative user roles**.<br> 2.  Validate the current administrative user ID or set a new user. <br> 3.  Go to **Resources > Resource Environment > Resource Environment Providers > WP AccessControlDataManagementService > Custom properties**. <br> 4.  Validate the values for the administrative users and groups of the different domains. If necessary, update the values to a valid user. <br><br> **Valid users:** To find valid users, go to **Users and Groups > Manage Users** to search for valid users.|

|Clean up step|Complete the following steps from the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console to change the repository: <br> 1.  Go to **Security > Global Security > Federated repositories > Supported entity types**. <br> 2.  Click one of the following options to edit the **Base Entry for the Default Parent** to the specific Base Entry for your target repository: <br> -  **Group** <br> - **OrgContainer** <br> - **PersonAccount**|
