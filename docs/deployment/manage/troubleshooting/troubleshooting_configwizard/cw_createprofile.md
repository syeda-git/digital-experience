# Troubleshooting: Create an HCL Digital Experience profile

View troubleshooting information for creating an HCL Digital Experience profile.

Each potential step in the configuration is included. Because the steps vary depending on your selections, the steps are not numbered. Find the step that failed to learn more about correcting and recovering from the failure. If you need to change a value that you entered in the wizard, then you must run the configuration again.

!!!note "Tip"
    If you must go through the wizard again, download the wizard selections that you made to save time. Then, cancel the configuration. Start the process over and upload your saved selections. Correct or enter values for the parameters that caused the failure.

If you are on HCL Portal Version 8.5 without a Combined Cumulative Fix applied, then you can use this option in the Configuration Wizard to create an additional profile.

!!!important
    You cannot complete this configuration option, if you have CF01 or a later Combined Cumulative Fix applied.

## Create the target profile for HCL Digital Experience in the WebSphere Application Server

**About this task:**

If the step fails, see the logs for the `manageprofiles` command to determine why the step failed. The wizard uses the portal profile templates to create the deployment manager profile. An error might result from a problem with the profile templates. The error message in the log provides more information.

The log files are in the app_server_root/logs/manageprofiles directory.

!!!important
    WebSphere® Application Server Version 8.5.5.5 requires that fix PI37248 is applied when creating the managed portal profile. This step fails if PI37248 is not installed.
