# Troubleshooting: Migrate the deployment manager profile for a cluster environment

If you encounter a failure during the configuration process, determine whether you can run the step again, skip the step, or if you must clean up the step. For some failed steps, learn how to correct the issue and recover from the failure.

Each potential step in the configuration is included. Because the steps vary depending on your selections, the steps are not numbered. Find the step that failed to learn more about correcting and recovering from the failure. If you need to change a value that you entered in the wizard, then you must run the configuration again.

!!!note "Tip"
    If you must go through the wizard again, download the wizard selections that you made to save time. Then, cancel the configuration. Start the process over and upload your saved selections. Correct or enter values for the parameters that caused the failure.
