# User roles and access

Different users will have different access to items and functions in your system depending on the role they are assigned. Roles can be assigned at the library level, and also assigned on individual items.

## Assigning access to items

There are two methods that are used to assign roles to access controls on items:

-   Selecting users or groups directly in the access section of an item.
-   Allowing assigned roles to be inherited from parent items up to and including the library. Access roles are inherited in the following hierarchies:

    -   Library/site area/content item
    -   Library/taxonomy/category
    -   Library/folder/component
    -   Library/folder/authoring template
    -   Library/folder/presentation template
    -   Library/workflow
    -   Library/workflow stage
    -   Library/workflow action
    You can stop inheritance at any point in an inheritance hierarchy. For example, you might allow inheritance down to a site area, but assign access roles manually for each content item under that site area.

    Inheritance from a library is based on the role that is assigned to the overall library, not on the role that is assigned to specific item types. For example, you might not have access to the presentation template view on a library, but if you inherit the role of editor to a presentation template, you are able to view and edit that presentation template from the All Items view.

    Inheritance does not apply to draft items.


!!!note
    By default, inheritance is enabled for all roles and items.

## Viewing an item's security settings

The following sections are displayed on the security section of each item.

|Section|Details|
|:------|:------|
|**User Defined**|If the item is not participating in a workflow, the user can edit access under user-defined.|
|**Workflow**|If an item is participating in a workflow, then the user-defined option does not appear and the workflow settings are displayed. This cannot be edited. Workflow-defined access is set in workflow stages.<br> **Published items and workflow defined item security:**<br> - If you grant a user editor access to an item in a workflow stage that uses a publish action, then those users are able to edit the published item directly. No draft is created. The same is true for administrator defined security when applied to published items.<br> - If you grant a user manager access to an item in a workflow stage that uses a publish action, then those users are able to edit and delete the published item directly. No draft is created. The same is true for administrator defined security when applied to published items.<br> - If you grant a user reviewer access to an item in a workflow stage that uses a publish action, then those users are able to create drafts of the published item.|
|**Administrator Defined**|Administrators can edit user access to an item at any time by changing the administrator defined settings.|
|**Inheritance**|You can also choose to inherit access that is assigned in the current web content library, or from an item's parent. Inheritance for all user roles is enabled by default.|

## How security is set

When a new item is created, the creator is automatically given manager access to the item. Extra user and group security can be added in the user-defined and system defined settings.

If an item is participating in a workflow, the creator is given manager access to the item only in the first workflow stage. As the item progresses through a workflow, the item security is determined by the combined workflow and system defined security.

|Security level|No workflow|First workflow stage|Extra workflow stages|
|--------------|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|
|**User**<br>**Contributor**<br>**Editor**<br>**Manager**<br>**Reviewer**<br>**Draft Creator**|- User defined<br> - Administrator defined<br> - Inherited| - Administrator defined<br> - Workflow defined| - Administrator defined<br> - Workflow defined|
|**Administrator**|If you are assigned the administrator role to a library, you automatically inherit all administration access down to the item-level. It cannot be turned off.|If you are assigned the administrator role to a library, you automatically inherit all administration access down to the item-level. It cannot be turned off.|If you are assigned the administrator role to a library, you automatically inherit all administration access down to the item-level. It cannot be turned off.|

**Notes on Deleting:**

-   When a new item is created, the creator can also delete the item. If an item is participating in a workflow, the creator can delete the item in the first workflow stage only.
-   When an item is deleted, the item will only be visible to the user who deleted the item. This can be viewed in their deleted view if they have the appropriate **Restore** or **Administrator** permission.

## Assigning access to different types of users or groups

When you access a website or rendering portlet, users login as either anonymous users, or authenticated portal users.

The following user and groups can be used to grant access to items.

|User or group|Details|
|-------------|-------|
|**anonymous portal user**|Select this user to grant access to anonymous users|
|**\[all users\]**|Select this group to grant access to all users, anonymous and authenticated.|
|**\[all authenticated portal users\]**|Select this group to grant access to all authenticated users.|
|**\[all portal user groups\]**|Select this group to grant access to all user groups.|
|**\[creator\]**|Select this group to grant access to the creator of the item.|
|**\[authors\]**|Select this group to grant access to users who are selected as an "author" of the item.|
|**\[owners\]**|Select this group to grant access to users who are selected as an "owner" of the item.|

## The access required to view a rendered item

To view an item on a rendered page, you need the following:

1.  You need at least user access to the library the item is stored in.
2.  You need at least user access to the presentation template used to display the current content item.
3.  There must be a valid template map.
4.  You must have sufficient access to view the item itself.

    Rendered item behavior varies depending on how you specify the `wcm.path.traversal.security` property in the `WCM WCMConfigService` service. If the property is not specified, the default value is `false`.

    If set to `false`:

    -   Menus display content regardless of whether a user has access to all site areas in the content path.
    -   Navigators do not display site areas a user does not have access to, but can show content under these site areas in specific circumstances such as within breadcrumb navigators.
    -   URLs are only checked for content access, not site area access.
    If set to `true`:

    -   Menus and navigators do not display content under secure site areas if the user does not have access to all site areas in the content path.
    -   Directly accessing content under secure site areas using a URL fails if the user does not have access to all site areas in the content path.
    Rendering performance is slower if set to true.


## Button access

You assign item-level access by assigning users and groups different roles for each item. The role that you assign determines what actions a user has access to for each item. The following table describes the minimum access that is required for access to each button in the user interface. If you enable inheritance at the library level, the library access level is inherited by item level access by default. For example, giving a user editor access to a library is automatically applied to new items they create if inheritance is enabled.

**Creating new items:**

The ability to create new items is set at the library level, not item level. You must have at least contributor access to a library and editor access to an item-type to create a new item. If you have access to create any item type, you can also create folders and projects.

**Button access on content items:**

You can choose to hide selected buttons on content item forms when you create an authoring template. This means that a user may not have access to all buttons on a content item form regardless of their role. Administrators can choose to display hidden buttons if required.

**Profiling versus security:**

Using profiling to personalize a site is different from using security to limit what items a user can access. In a profile-based personalized site, although a user might not be able to access all the pages by using personalized menus, they might still be able to access other pages by using navigators, or by searching for content. In a secured site, a user can only view items that they are granted access to.
