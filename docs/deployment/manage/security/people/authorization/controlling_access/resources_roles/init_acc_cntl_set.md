# Initial Access Control Settings

The administrative user who installs HCL Digital Experience has a default set of access rights.

## Portal administrative user access rights

The installation creates a dedicated administrative user and corresponding administrative user group. By default the name of the administrative user group is **wpsadmins**. The following information describes the initial access control settings. A user always has the permissions that are associated with the User, Editor, and Privileged User role types on itself. There is no explicit role assignment for these permissions. They are a part of the administration policy.

-   **Administrative user**

    The administrative user for each domain is identified during the installation and configured in the Access Control Data Management Service. The administrative user has unlimited access on all resource in the corresponding domain.

-   **wpsadmins**

    The administrative group for each domain is identified during the installation and configured in the Access Control Data Management Service. This group has the same role mappings as the administrative user.

-   **All Authenticated Portal Users**
