# Access permissions

Learn about sensitive operations for resources and the roles that are required to perform those operations. Sensitive operations include common tasks such as viewing portlets on specific pages and complex, high-risk tasks like running XML configuration interface scripts.

Roles provide permissions for user to perform specific operations on resources. The following tables denote roles as follows: `Role@Resource`.

**Notes about the following tables:**

-   The following tables list minimum role assignments that are necessary to perform sensitive operations. Roles are organized in a hierarchy. Roles that are higher in the hierarchy generally include the permissions of roles that are lower in the role hierarchy. For example, to install web modules the editor role on the virtual resource `Web Modules`, `Editor@Web Modules`, is the minimum role assignment for this operation. The manager role is higher in the hierarchy than the editor role. For this reason, the manager role includes the permissions of the editor role. `Manager@Web Modules` also allows users to install web modules.
-   When access permissions are granted to any listed resource, it inherently requires access to the resource Access Control Administration.
-   Use the Access Control Administration to change the owner of a resource.
-   The resources that are listed can be different depending on other products that might be installed with the product. Some roles are required on virtual resources; other roles must be on resource instances.
-   Users might also have access permissions for some operations through ownership of resources.
-   Definition of terms:
    -   ****private****

        Accessible only by the owner of the resource.

        **Note:** Creators of private resources automatically gain rights that are similar to the rights of a Manager. For example, if you create a private page, you have rights similar to manager for that page. You can also perform certain actions such as changing the page theme or deleting the page.

    -   ****non-private****

        Accessible by those people who were granted access to the resource.

    -   ****public****

        Accessible without authentication.

## Role Mappings and WSRP services

On the WSRP producer side, you can set the configuration property wsrp.security.enabled to enforce the access control decision for the provided portlets. If this property value is set to true, then all access control decisions in the producing portal are based on the authenticated principal. If wsrp.security.enabled is set to false, then the producing portal does not enforce any access control on incoming client portal WSRP requests.

When you use identity propagation, the user who is authenticated on the client portal needs to have the required role assignments. If no identity propagation is configured, but SSL client certificate authentication is enabled, then the ID of the certificate needs to have the required role assignments. If no authentication method is used, then the request is treated as if it comes from the Anonymous Portal Users. In the latter case, the required roles need to be assigned to the Anonymous Portal User. This assignment implies allowing unauthenticated access to the corresponding resources for all users who can access the producer portal.
