# Managing credential information

Credential Vault holds credential information and allows portlets to access the credentials to provide single sign-on authentication. Credential Vault allows you to add and manage vault segments and resources as well as managing system and user vault slot. You can create a vault slot for each known application in the portal that requires access to secure resources.
