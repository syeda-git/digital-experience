# Configuring the Users and Groups portlet



You can configure the settings for the **Manage Users and Groups** portlet

The following configurations are possible depending on how the views are programmed and what access permissions a user has:

|Type of configuration|Portlet mode|Description|Portlet mode selection options|
|---------------------|------------|-----------|------------------------------|
|Administrator configuration|`config`|Changes made here affect *all occurrences* of the portlet on *all* pages for *all* users. The administration portlets allow you to create multiple copies of the same portlet with different administrator level configurations.|Configure|
|Shared configuration|`edit_defaults`|Changes made here affect a *particular occurrence* of a portlet on a page and apply to all users who view the portlet on that page.|Edit shared settings|
|Personal configuration|`personalize`, `view`, `help`|Changes made here are associated with a *single user* and apply only to that particular user who views the portlet on the page. Only that user can make that update.|Personalize, View, Help|
