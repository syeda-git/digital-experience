# Placing a resource under external control


By default, resources are under the internal control of the portal. You might want to manage some resources with an external security manager. Private resources cannot be externalized.

An icon in the External access control column indicates whether a resource is externally or internally managed.

Complete the following steps to place a resource under external control:

1.  Click the appropriate **Move External** icon.

2.  Click **Yes**.
