# Configuring the Resource Permissions portlet



You can modify the search results of this portlet by changing the number of resources that a search retrieves and by changing the number of items that display on a page.

Depending on your access rights, you can configure or edit some the standard features of this portlet. If you select **Configuration**, changes affect all occurrences of the portlet on all pages for all users. If you select **Edit shared settings**, changes affect a particular instance of a portlet on a page and apply to all users who view that instance of the portlet on that page or on pages that are derived from that page. Changes made in Edit shared settings override changes made in Configuration.

Perform the following steps to make changes:

1.  Select **Edit shared settings** or **Configuration** from the portlet menu.

2.  Enter the number of items that the search will return in the **Get this initial number of resources** field.

3.  Enter the number of search result items to display on a page in the **Number of items per page** field.

4.  Click **OK** to continue or **Cancel** to quit.


To see updates, log out of the portal, and then log back in.
