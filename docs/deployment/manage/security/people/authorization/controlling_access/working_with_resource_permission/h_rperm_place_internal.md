# Placing a resource back under internal control


If control of a resource has been moved to an external security manager, such as Tivoli Access Manager, you can move it back to the portal's internal control.

An icon in the External access control column indicates whether a resource is externally or internally managed.

Perform the following steps to bring a resource back to internal control:

1.  Click the appropriate **Bring Internal** icon.

2.  Click **Yes**.
