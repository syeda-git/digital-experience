# Removing a role block



You can restore inherited role assignments by removing a role block. All users and groups who do not have explicitly assigned roles on a resource are affected by removing a role block.

Perform the following steps to remove a role block:

1.  On the initial **Resource Permissions** screen, click the appropriate **resource type** . If necessary, search for the appropriate resource instance.

2.  Click the **Edit Access** icon of the required resource type.

3.  To remove a propagation block, click the **Allow Propagation** check box so that a check mark appears. Children of the resource will now inherit all assignments for this role type.

4.  To remove an inheritance block, click the **Allow Inheritance** check box so that a check mark appears. The resource will now inherit all assignments for this role type from the parent resource.

5.  Click **OK** to save changes.
