# Changing the WebSphere Application Server administrator password in the LDAP server using the LDAP administration interface

If you are using the IBM Directory Server or IBM SecureWay Security Server for z/OS and OS/390 LDAP server, you can change the IBM WebSphere Application Server administrator password in the LDAP server using the LDAP administration interface. If you are using any other LDAP server, refer to the product documentation for information about changing passwords.

Perform the following steps to change the WebSphereÂ® Application Server administrator password in the LDAP server using the LDAP administration interface:

!!!attention
    The following directions assume an LDAP tree layout where the users are all in the cn=users,o=wps subtree in the directory server. You should adjust these directions based on your own LDAP server layout.
