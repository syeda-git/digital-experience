# Enabling HTTP Basic Authentication for simple clients

HCL Portal provides an HTTP Basic Authentication Trust Association Interceptor that can be enabled to allow specific clients to log into the portal by using HTTP Basic Authentication instead of HTTP Form Based Authentication.


-   **[The HTTP Basic Authentication Trust Association Interceptor](taic_hba_tai.md)**  
The HTTP Basic Authentication Trust Association Interceptor (TAI) can be used to authenticate incoming requests using the HTTP Basic Authentication Protocol described in RFC 2617. This can be useful for clients that are not capable of doing HTTP FORM based authentication.
-   **[Configuring the HTTP Basic Authentication Trust Association Interceptor](tait_cfg_hba4sc.md)**  
To configure the HTTP Basic Authentication Trust Association Interceptor according to your requirements, you set its properties.
-   **[Reference: Properties for the Trust Association Interceptor](tair_props.md)**  
The HTTP Basic Authentication Trust Association Interceptor has several configuration properties.
-   **[HTTP Basic Authentication Trust Association Interceptor in combination with external authentication servers](taic_comb_ext.md)**  
When you use the HTTP Basic Authentication Trust Association Interceptor (TAI) with external authentication servers, you can configure the TAI to work for a specific set of requests.
