# Security Access Manager Permissions

In many installations, WebSEAL is behind Portal between the portlets and the back-end servers they access.

Portlets require some method of getting through the ESM to the back-end, and that the portlets can use the Portal credential vault. The portlets are themselves designed to reuse existing security tokens from the Portal security context.
