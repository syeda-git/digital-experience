# Deleting your user registry configurations

After you deploy HCL Digital Experience, you might not require some of the LDAP entity types, realms, realm base entries, or repositories that you created. You can delete these configurations to achieve the correct user registry configuration.

Choose from the following tasks to delete your user registry configurations:

-   **[Deleting the LDAP entity type](del_ldap_entitytype.md)**  
If you changed your LDAP user registry and no longer require an entity type, you can delete it.
-   **[Deleting the base entry](delete_be.md)**  
If you changed your LDAP user registry and no longer require a base entry, you can delete it.
-   **[Deleting the LDAP group member](delete_ldap_gm.md)**  
If you changed your LDAP user registry and no longer require the group member, you can delete it from the LDAP user registry.
-   **[Deleting the realm](delete_realm.md)**  
If you changed your HCL Digital Experience and no longer require a realm, you can delete it from your user registry.
-   **[Deleting the realm base entry](delete_realm_be.md)**  
If you changed your realm and no longer require the base entry for that realm, you can delete it.
-   **[Deleting the repository](delete_repository.md)**  
If you no longer require the use of a repository within your federated repository, you can delete it from your configuration.
