# Enable federated security

You can use the Configuration Wizard to configure HCL Portal to use a federated LDAP for security. Use the following information to get familiar with the information you must provide in the wizard and the configuration procedure that it generates.

## Configuration Wizard

The primary Configuration Wizard options are based on your target configuration topology, such as a stand-alone server or a cluster. The federated security option is included with both **Set Up a Stand-alone Server** and **Set Up a Cluster**. For the stand-alone server topology, run the federated security option after database transfer. For the cluster topology, run the federated security option after you create the cluster, but before you add more nodes.

## Validation

For this configuration option, the wizard can connect to your LDAP directory and validate the information that you enter in the wizard. By default, validation is enabled. On the Security Settings panel, you can choose to turn validation on or off by selecting **Yes** or **No** to the **Validate LDAP user registry entries** option. Select **No** if you know that your parameters are correct and that your LDAP server is unavailable at the time of creating your instructions.

Two types of validation are performed when you select to validate settings including field syntax and LDAP connection validations. The syntax validation, for example, checks that you entered a valid port number in the range of 1 - 65535. The connection validation, for example, checks that a connection can be made to your LDAP server.

Enabling validation is recommended because it can prevent a possible failure by validating your entries in the wizard before you run the configuration. The LDAP settings including the **Repository ID**, **Host name**, **Port**, **Bind DN**, **Bind password**, **Base DN**, **Administrator group DN**, **Administrator DN**, and **Administrator password** are all validated before the wizard creates your instructions to run the configuration. Review the following worksheet section to see which fields are required based on your selections in the wizard.


# Worksheet

When you set up the federated security, you answer questions about your wanted configuration. Some fields apply to all federated security configurations. Some fields are required based on your environment. The remaining fields are advanced and do not apply to most configurations.

## Minimal required fields

The following table lists the fields that are unique to the LDAP configuration. You might be prompted for additional information about system or user IDs and passwords that you defined during the portal installation process.

!!!attention
    The Enable Federated Security option modifies the wimconfig.xml file. Make a backup copy of this file before you run any of the configuration tasks.

```
[wp\_profile\_root](../../../manage/wpsdirstr#wp_profile_root)/config/cells/CellName/wim/config/wimconfig.xml
```

## Nested or dynamic group support

If you need nested group support, then the wizard provides default values for some of the advanced fields. The default values are based on your LDAP server selection. You must click **Advanced** to see the fields if you want to verify the defaults. Nested or dynamic group support fields include **Group member attribute**, **Membership attribute name**, **LDAP group objectclasses**, and **GC member attribute scope**.

# Enabling federated security

After you answer questions and provide information about your LDAP, the wizard generates a custom configuration procedure.

Depending on your environment, the wizard generates a configuration process. The following steps reflect all possible steps in the configuration process. The steps do not represent a literal configuration. The steps are provided as a reference.

If you click **View Step Command**, you can see the task and properties that are associated with each step in the wizard.
