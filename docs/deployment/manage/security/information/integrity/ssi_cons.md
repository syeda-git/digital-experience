# Configuring Session Security Integration

IBM WebSphere Application Server protects your session from access by other users.

To use Session Security Integration, you must enable it on both HCL Digital Experience and WebSphereÂ® Application Server functionality as well. WebSphere Application Server will preserve an available security context even if an unprotected URI is accessed.

!!! note
    Session security integration is enabled by default on later WAS versions and HCL Digital Experience Containers.
