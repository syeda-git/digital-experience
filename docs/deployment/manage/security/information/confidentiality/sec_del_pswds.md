# Deleting passwords from properties files

The configuration tasks might require you to write security-sensitive information, such as passwords, into multiple properties files. When you no longer need this security-sensitive information for your configuration, you should remove them and move the files to a safe place or set the file permissions so that only authorized users can read them.

**z/OS only:** Job **EJPSDPW** is generated when you generate the instructions for the **Basic Portal Configuration**. Run this job to remove the passwords from the configuration scripts.

Complete the following steps to delete passwords and other security-sensitive information from the properties files:

!!!note
    After completing the tasks to clean up the work directory and delete the passwords, you might find that in order to successfully perform additional configuration tasks, you need these passwords. Some tasks require you to add the passwords back to the wkplc.properties, wkplc\_comp.properties, wkplc\_dbdomain.properties, and wkplc\_sourceDb.properties files while other tasks allow you to specify the passwords on the command line using the –D flag. Refer to the configuration task documentation to determine which method is required.

1.  Complete the following steps to access the HCL Portal configuration directory:

3.  Enter the following commands from the configuration directory to remove all passwords from the wkplc.properties, wkplc\_comp.properties, wkplc\_sourceDb.properties, and wkplc\_dbdomain.properties files:

    -   Windows: ConfigEngine.bat delete-passwords -DWasPassword=password
    -   AIXSolarisLinux: ./ConfigEngine.sh delete-passwords -DWasPassword=password
