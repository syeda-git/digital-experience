# Configuring a remote web server

To enable communication between the web server and WebSphere Application Server, a web server plug-in is required. The web server plug-in determines whether a request is handled by the web server or by the application server. The plug-in can be installed into a web server that is located either on the same server as WebSphere Application Server or on a separate server. The web server plug-in uses an XML configuration file \(plugin-cfg.xml\) that contains settings that describe how to handle and pass on requests to the WebSphere Application Server made accessible through the plug-in.

In the WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console, the web server is represented as a specific server type, and you can view or modify all of the configuration properties that are used in the plugin-cfg.xml file for the web server plug-in from the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console.

    For some portal functions to work, you must make sure that the web server write and delete operations are allowed. These operations enable the HTTP operations POST, PUT, and DELETE. For example, these operations are required for the toolbar.
