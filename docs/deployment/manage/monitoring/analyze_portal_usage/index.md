# Analyzing portal usage data

You can collect data about the usage of your portal and analyze them.

You can collect these types of data:

-   Server side data of your portal site. This consists mainly of technical data internal to the portal.
-   Server side data of your HCL Web Content Manager items.
-   Data about the behavior of your client users. You analyze this data by using Active Site Analytics (ASA).
