# Managing Single sign-on settings in your cluster

If you configured the nodes in your cluster to use single sign-on (SSO), you can change the SSO settings for the cluster.

Complete the following steps to manage your Single Sign-on settings:

1.  In the deployment manager WebSphereÂ® Integrated Solutions Console, go to **Security > Global security**.

2.  Under **Authentication**, click **Web and SIP security**.

3.  Click **Single sign-on (SSO).**

4.  Update your SSO settings and then click **OK**.

5.  Click **Preferences**, check the check box **Synchronize changes with Nodes**, and then click **Apply**.

6.  Click **Save** to update the deployment manager configuration.

7.  Restart all servers in the cell, including the node agents and the deployment manager.
