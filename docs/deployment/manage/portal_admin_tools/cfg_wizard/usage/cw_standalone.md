# Configuration Wizard: Set up a stand-alone server

Use the Configuration Wizard to set up a stand-alone server. A stand-alone server is useful for different environments, such as a content authoring environment, test environment, and more.

## Before you begin
Roadmaps provide an overview of the steps that are required for common environment configurations. Select the roadmap that is most like the environment that you want to set up. See [HCL Digital Experience roadmaps for stand-alone servers](../../../../../get_started/plan_deployment/traditional_deployment/roadmaps/rm_install_deployment/rm_standalone_servers/rm_standalone_parent.md) for more information.
