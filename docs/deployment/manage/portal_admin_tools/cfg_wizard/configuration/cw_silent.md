# Running the Configuration Wizard silently

You can run the Configuration Wizard silently if you have multiple deployments or if you want to develop a common deployment template.

1.  Choose one of the following options to prepare to run the Configuration Wizard silently:

    -   Generate the customization data file in the configuration wizard without running the tasks.
    -   Modify the sample customization data file that matches your deployment. This file is in the PortalServer_root/installer/samples/configwizard directory.

    !!!important
        The sample scenarios do not cover all deployment options. Therefore, if the samples do not match your deployment scenario, generate the customization data file.

2.  Open a command prompt.

3.  Change to the wp_profile_root/ConfigEngine directory.

4.  Create a silent installation from a set of customization data:

    !!!note
        All parameters are necessary. Run this task once per deployment cycle.

    -   AIX® and Linux™: `./ConfigEngine.sh customize-workflow -DwfId=workflow-identifier -DwfData=customization-data-file -DwfOutput=output-directory -DWasPassword=password`<br>
    -   Windows™: `ConfigEngine.bat customize-workflow -DwfId=workflow-identifier -DwfData=customization-data-file -DwfOutput=output-directory -DWasPassword=password`
    
    Where `workflow-identifier` is the name in the repository.

    Where `customization-data-file` is the name of the customization data file.

    Where `output-directory` is the directory where resulting files are written. This directory includes the following content:
    -   The `workflow-identifier.wfi` file that represents the combination of silent installation tasks and the custom data. Subsequent tasks use this file.
    -   The `workflow-identifier` directory where scripts and related files are created.

5.  Start the silent installation:

    -   AIX and Linux: `./ConfigEngine.sh execute-workflow -DwfInstance=workflow-instance -DWasPassword=password`
    -   Windows: `ConfigEngine.bat execute-workflow -DwfInstance=workflow-instance -DWasPassword=password`
    
    This task runs until:
    -   A step in the silent installation fails. You must correct the error and then run the `resume-workflow` task.
    -   A step is reached that requires manual action. You must finish the requested action and then run the `resume-workflow` task.

6.  To resume the silent installation, run the `resume-workflow` task:

    -   AIX and Linux: `./ConfigEngine.sh resume-workflow -DWasPassword=password`
    -   Windows: `ConfigEngine.bat resume-workflow -DWasPassword=password`
    
    This task works in the following way:

    -   If you resume the silent installation after an error, the task runs the failed step.
    -   If you resume after you complete a manual step, the task runs the next step in the sequence.
