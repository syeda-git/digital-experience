# Language support

To reach as many users as possible, HCL Digital Experience supports different languages for different locations. For instance, a large, international corporation might address users in different countries or regions through multilingual Web sites. In this context the portal can concurrently serve portal views to large numbers of users, each in the user's preferred language.

If necessary, the portal can support portlets that are shown in different languages. If portlets do not support a requested language, the portal tries to match the user's language preference as well as possible. For example, if a page for a Japanese user shows several portlets in Japanese and a portlet is added that only supports English, then the page shows the new portlet in English but still shows the other portlets in Japanese.

!!!note
    Some back-level versions of browsers and browsers that are not commonly used might have difficulty representing specific languages, depending on the defined character set. In these cases, in order for the language to be rendered correctly, it might be necessary to define the same preferred language for the browser and the portal it accesses.
