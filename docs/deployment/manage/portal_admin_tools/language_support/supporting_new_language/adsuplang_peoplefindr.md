# Globalization for People Finder fields

All fields of the People Finder portlet must have associated language strings that are defined in each language property file, PeopleFinderUI_language_code.properties. The field names are the names of the corresponding attributes in Member Manager.

For each People Finder field, the following three strings are required:

-   One string for the field name, which is the attribute name
-   One string for the field long name
-   One string for the field description as it appears in the tasks of People Finder configuration mode

Example:

```
displayName = Name
displayName_Long = Preferred Name
displayName_Desc = Display name

```

The resource key for each field refers to the appropriate language property file, `/nls/PeopleFinderUI_language_code.properties`. Language translations of People Finder fields must be stored in the appropriate language property file.

Language properties files are in the following location on the HCL Portal server: PortalServer_root/people/people.impl/peoplefinder/portlet/nnnnnnn.ear/lwp_peoplefinder_war.ear/lwp.peoplefinder.jsr168.war/WEB-INF/lib

The variable nnnnnnn represents a random number that is generated by the installation process when the `lwppeoplefinder.jar` file is installed.
