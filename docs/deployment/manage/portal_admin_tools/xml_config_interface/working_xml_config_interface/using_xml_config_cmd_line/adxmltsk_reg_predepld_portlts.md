# Registering predeployed portlets

You can manually predeploy portlet application WAR files using the WebSphere Integrated Solutions Console. You can later register and configure the predeployed portlet applications into HCL Digital Experience, together with other J2EE resources and artifacts, by using the XML configuration interface.

To install a predeployed portlet, use the sample file RegisterPreDeployedEAR.xml. You might have to change this sample for your requirements. For more information about how to predeploy portlets refer to the topic about *Deploying J2EE resources*.
