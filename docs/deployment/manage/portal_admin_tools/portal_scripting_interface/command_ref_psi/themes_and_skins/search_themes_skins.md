# Search - Themes and Skins

The syntax for searching is similar to the generic tree search described in Search. Since the look bean does not support a current selection, the search is not scoped and the keyword select is not supported for the find command. The command deselect (Navigation) can be used to ensure that a search is global, even if a search scope is introduced in the future.

The look bean supports the default search criteria, and the following keywords for node types in searches. Alternative keywords are documented in the bean help.

-   theme
-   skin

Since the sets of themes and skins are distinct, there is no option to search for both type of nodes at the same time.
