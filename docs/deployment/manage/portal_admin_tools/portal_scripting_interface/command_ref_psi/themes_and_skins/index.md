# Themes and Skins

Themes and skins are two distinct sets of objects with a matrix relation, where each skin can be tied to any number of themes. The sets of themes and skins are accessible through the Look bean, which is referenced as $Look in Jacl.

The Look bean provides access to the portal theme and skin objects:

-   Methods that allow to search on themes. For more information, see *Search*.
-   Methods for getting attributes. Themes and Skins support the default attributes. Only the get command is available. Since there is no current selection, the ID of the node for which to obtain an attribute value must be given explicitly.
-   Methods to retrieve theme and skin lists. For more information, see *Global lists*.
