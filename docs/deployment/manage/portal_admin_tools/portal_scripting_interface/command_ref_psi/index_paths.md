# Index paths | Portal scripting interface

Index paths are used to refer to components in the component hierarchy. They are based on the index or position of a component in the surrounding container. An index path is a multidimensional index of a component, where the number of dimensions is equal to the depth of the component in the tree. Index paths are absolute or relative, depending on whether there is a leading slash. Absolute paths start with a leading slash and are resolved from the root component. Relative paths start with a number and are resolved from the selected component. Trailing slashes are irrelevant.
