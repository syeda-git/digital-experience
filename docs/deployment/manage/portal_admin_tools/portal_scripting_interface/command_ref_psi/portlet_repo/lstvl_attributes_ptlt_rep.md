# List valued attributes - Portlet repository

The portlet nodes have two list valued attributes, locales and parameters. See the bean help for alternative, shorter names for these lists.

Only the list command is supported, you cannot modify the lists. The locales list is available for portlets and portlet applications. It holds the locales for which locale-specific attributes are defined in locale-specific attributes. The parameters list holds the setting names for the init parameter that are associated with the specified portlet.
