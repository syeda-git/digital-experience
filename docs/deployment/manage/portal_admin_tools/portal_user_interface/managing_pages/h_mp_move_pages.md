# Moving pages and labels


You can move a page and its children to another location in the portal hierarchy from Manage Pages.

The same steps can also be used to move a label and its children. To move page and labels, do the following steps:

1.  To open the **Manage Pages** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal User Interface > Manage Pages**.

2.  In Manage Pages, go to the page that you want to move.

3.  Click the **Mark** icon. A message is displayed confirming that the page you selected and its subpages are ready to be moved.

4.  Go to the page into which you want to move the marked page.

5.  Click **Move**. A message is displayed prompting you to confirm the new location.

6.  Click **OK**to complete the operation.


After successful completion, the page or label is shown in its new location in Manage Pages.

When you mark a page to be moved, it remains marked until one of these events occurs:

-   Your session with the portal is ended (for example, by logging out).
-   You mark another page before you move the original marked page. Only one page can be marked.
-   You move the page to the new location.
