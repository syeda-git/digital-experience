# Assigning access to pages, labels, and URLs



You can set access permissions by navigating to the page, label, or URL to which you want to assign or modify access. Click the **Set page permissions** icon to change permissions for the resource.

By default, all pages in the Manage Pages portlet on which a user has Editor or Privileged User role or greater will be in navigation menu. This setting can be changed by modifying the `showbypermission` value to no. When this parameter is set to no, all pages on which the user has User role or greater will be in navigation menu.
