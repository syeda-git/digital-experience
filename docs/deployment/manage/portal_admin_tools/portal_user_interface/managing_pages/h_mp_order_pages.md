1.  To open the **Manage Pages** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal User Interface > Manage Pages**.

2.  Click the **Move an item up** icon to move an item up one row in the table.

3.  Click the **Move an item down** icon to move an item down one row in the table.
