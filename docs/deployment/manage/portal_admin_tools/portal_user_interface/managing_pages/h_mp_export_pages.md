# Exporting pages and labels



Exporting allows you to create a response file so that the page or label and its child nodes can be imported into another portal server by using the XML configuration interface.

Follow these steps to export a page. The same steps can also be used to export a label.

!!!note
    For the export to work, you must enable support for JavaScript and disable pop-up blocking in your browser settings.

1.  To open the **Manage Pages** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal User Interface > Manage Pages**.

2.  Go to the page that contains the node that you want to export.

3.  Click the **Export** icon next to the node. You are prompted for further information.

4.  Make one of the following selections:

    -   Click **Yes** to export the page and all of the child pages that it contains.
    -   Click **No** to export just the selected page.
    
    You are prompted by the browser to download the exported file.

5.  Select a location to save the export file.


When you are finished, a success message is displayed in Manage Pages. The portal configuration is saved to the location of your choice.
