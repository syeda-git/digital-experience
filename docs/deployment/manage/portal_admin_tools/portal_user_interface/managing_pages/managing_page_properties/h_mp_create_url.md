# Creating a URL


You can create URLs to add external URLs to your portal navigation.

To create a new URL, do the following steps:

1.  To open the **Manage Pages** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal User Interface > Manage Pages**.

2.  Click **New URL** to create a new URL. You leave **Manage Pages** to create the new URL.

3.  Type the title of the new URL in **Title**. This is the title for the default locale.

4.  Select the type of URL. You can create an internal or external URL.

    -   For internal URLs, select **A link to the following portal page**. Internal URLs direct the user to a page within the portal site. You can select only from pages that can be bookmarked. Also, you cannot create a URL to a first-level page. Instead, you must select one of the available child pages.
    -   For external URLs, select **A link to a Web page with the following URL**. External URLs direct the user to a location outside of the portal site. Select at least one markup, such as HTML, and the URL for that markup type.

5.  Click **OK** to save these settings for the new URL. Click **Cancel** if you want to return to without creating the new URL.
