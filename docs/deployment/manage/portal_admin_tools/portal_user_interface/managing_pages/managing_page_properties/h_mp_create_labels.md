# Creating a label


You can create a label to act as a separator to organize pages and URLs.

Labels can be used to help organize groups of pages and URLs into categories. For example, you can create a Music label to separate your music pages and URLs from other media URLs.

To create a new label, do the following steps:

1.  To open the **Manage Pages** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal User Interface > Manage Pages**.

2.  Click **New label** to create a new label. You leave to create the new label.

3.  Type the title of the new label in **Title**. This is the title for the default locale.

4.  Select **Theme** to determine the look of the new label. **Note:** This option is only available when you create a root page.

5.  Continue to the next step to set advanced options. If you do not want to set advanced options, click **OK** to save the new label or **Cancel** to discard the label settings.

6.  Click **Advanced options** to view optional settings in this section.

7.  Check supported markup from **This page supports**. **Note:** You must select at least one supported markup to create the label. The default is HTML.

8.  Click **OK** to save these settings for the new label.
