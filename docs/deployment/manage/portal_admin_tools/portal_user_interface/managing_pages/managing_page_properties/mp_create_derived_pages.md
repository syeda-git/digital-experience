# Creating derived pages


A page can be set to reference an existing page only during page creation.

Wires created on a root page do not apply to derived pages that you create by referencing the root page. While such pages do inherit the content of the original page, this inheritance does not apply to wires; you have to explicitly create the wires for the derived page. Follow these steps to create and manage a derived page:

1.  When creating a page using the **Manage Pages** portlet, expand the **Type of Page** section.

2.  Click **Set page layout properties** and make sure that **Standard Portal Layout** is selected.

3.  Select **A page that uses content from a shared page**.

    You only see this option if you have another page in your portal that has "other pages can share the contents of this page" enabled.

4.  Select the parent page from the drop-down list and click **OK**.

5.  When you are finished setting other page properties, click **OK**.
