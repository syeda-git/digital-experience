# Activating or deactivating a page, label, or URL


You can deactivate a resource to prevent users from accessing it without having to change their user roles. You can toggle pages, labels, and URLs to be active or inactive from Manage Pages. If you deactivate a resource, users cannot access this inactive resource.

Pages and other portal resources can be in an active or inactive state. You must activate the resource before you or other users can view it. When a portlet application or portlet is in the active state, portal users with appropriate access can include it on their personal pages and customize it. If you deactivate a resource, users who have active references to the inactive resource on a portal page cannot access that inactive resource. Instead, they see a message that states the portlet is temporarily disabled. When you start working on a portlet, the portal changes its state to deactivated. After you complete work on the resource, remember to activate it so that users who have the appropriate access permissions can use it.

To activate or deactivate a page, label, or URL, you must have the Privileged User, Manager, Security Administrator, Editor, or Administrator role assignment. To activate or deactivate a page, label, or URL, do the following steps:

1.  To open the **Manage Pages** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal User Interface > Manage Pages**.

2.  Find in the table or use the search option to locate the page, label, or URL that you want to make active or inactive.

3.  Click **Activate** to activate the page or **Deactivate** to deactivate the page.
