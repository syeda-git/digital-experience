# Defining global targets

Learn how to define global targets.

Cross-page wires allow portlets to exchange properties across pages. Before you create a cross-page wire, you must define communication targets for the target page as **global** on its portlets. Defining a target as global will also make that target available to Click-to-Action menus. To set global targets on the target page, proceed by the following steps:

1.  Navigate to the target page on the portal.

2.  Select **Edit Page**

3.  Select the **Wires** tab.

4.  Click the **Define Global Targets . . .** button.

5.  Select **Global** to make a communication target on a portlet available to wires and Click-to-Action menus from cooperative portlets on other pages.

6.  Click **OK** to enable the communication targets.

7.  For details about how to add a cross-page wire refer to [Adding a wire](h_wires_add.md).
