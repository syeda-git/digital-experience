# Defining global targets using the context menu


Create wires between portlets on different pages. These special wires are called cross page wires. To indicate that a wire is a cross page wire, you mark the target event on the target portlet as a global target.

Use the **Global Targets** tab to define whether target events for the context portlet window are global targets or not.

-   The tab lists all defined target events for the current portlet, regardless of any existing wires for these events.
-   When an event is defined as a global target, it is listed highlighted and a special icon is displayed.
-   Hovering over an event reveals a context action that you use to toggle the global target status of this event.
