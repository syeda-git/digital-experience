# Deleting a wire using the context menu


The wires tab lists the existing wires that are heading away from the source portlet.

-   The wires that are listed in the dialog are grouped by target page and then by target portlet window.
-   For each page or window there is a list of wires.
-   Each entry in that list shows the source event and the target event.
-   To delete a wire, click the "x" icon that appears when hovering over the wire.
