# Editing page layout

The Edit Layout portlet allows you to add, remove, and arrange portlets on the page. You can also set column widths and select different page layouts. The tasks that you can perform may be limited if areas or content on the page is locked or you have insufficient access privileges.

A page is deactivated when you start making changes to it. While editing the page, all changes are effective immediately and cannot be undone or cancelled. Other users will not be able to access the page until you commit the changes by clicking **Done**.
