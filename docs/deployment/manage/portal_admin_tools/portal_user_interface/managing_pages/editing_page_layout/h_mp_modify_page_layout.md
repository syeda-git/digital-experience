# Modifying page layout


When you create a page, you can choose one of the layout templates displayed. In most cases, you need only to add portlets to one of those predetermined layouts.

If you need more control over the layout, click **Show layout tools** to display the advanced layout icons. You can nest spaces and add rows and columns.

Users can click the option **Show layout tools** only if the check box **Show toggle link** for **Show layout tools/hide layout tools** was enabled within the Configuration or Edit shared settings mode of the Edit Layout portlet.

!!!note
    Do not use the Edit Layout portlet to edit pages with static layout that were created by using the site toolbar. The Edit Layout portlet might not display static layout containers as expected.
