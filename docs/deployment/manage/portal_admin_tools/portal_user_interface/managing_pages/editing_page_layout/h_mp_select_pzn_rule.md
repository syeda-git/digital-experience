# Selecting a personalization rule


You can manage personalization rules for a particular portlet from the Edit Layout portlet.

In order to view portlet rule mappings, make sure that Show portlet rule mapping is enabled in the Edit Layout settings.

-   To select a rule, select **Select Rule** from the **No Rules Mapped To** drop-down list on the portlet. This takes you to the Personalization Rule Picker portlet. Once the rule is selected, you will be returned to the Edit Layout portlet.

-   To delete an existing rule, choose **Delete mapping** from the **No Rules Mapped To** drop-down list on the portlet.
