# Locking and unlocking static page content


Control changes to the content of a container on a static portal page.

You can prevent portal users from modifying the content of a container on a static page. If you lock the content of a container on a page, then a portlet cannot be added to that container, or moved into or out of that container.

1.  To open the **Manage Pages** portlet, click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Portal User Interface > Manage Pages**.

2.  Click the **Edit Page Layout** icon for the page that you would like to lock or unlock.

3.  Click the **Locks** tab.

4.  To lock the content of the container, click the lock icon. The icon shows a closed lock when the content of the container is locked, and an open lock when it is unlocked. Clicking the icon toggles back and forth between locked and unlocked.

5.  Click **Done** to save the changes to the page.

You can verify that the content of a container is locked by clicking the **Content** tab. If the content of a container box is locked, then it does not display an **Add portlet** button or any directional arrows.
