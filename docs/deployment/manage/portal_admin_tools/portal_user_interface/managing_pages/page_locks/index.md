# Using Page Locks

The Page Locks portlet allows the administrator to lock containers on a page and the content of the containers. As the administrator, you can also decide which portlets can or cannot be deleted from the page. These settings control how a user can work with the page in the Edit Layout and Content portlet.

An end user must have Editor role assignment for a page in order to modify the locks for containers or container contents.

Click **Edit Properties** to set the properties of pages, labels, and URLs. When you are finished in the Properties portlet, you will be returned to Page Locks. Click **Delete this page** to delete the current page. You will be prompted to confirm the deletion. When you are finished customizing the page locks, click **Done** to make the page available.
