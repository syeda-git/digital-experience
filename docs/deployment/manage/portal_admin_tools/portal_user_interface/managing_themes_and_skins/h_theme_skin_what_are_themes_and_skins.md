# Themes and skins
Learn how themes and skins can change the look of your site.

## What is a theme?

A theme is an interchangeable front end for a portal node or group of nodes. It controls elements such as the banner, navigation, and look and feel for a node. The option to set a theme is only available when creating a root node and any nodes nested immediately beneath that root node. For example, if the root page, sports, has a nested page, baseball, which has a nested page, homeruns, only the sports and baseball pages can be assigned a theme.

## What is a skin?

A skin is an interchangeable front end for a portlet. A skin controls elements such as the minimize and maximize icons, the title bar, and the background color or pattern.
