# Custom themes for administrative portlets

You can assign a custom look for the administrative portlets.

Administrative portlets include all of the portlets that appear on the administrative pages when you navigate to Administration. Administrative portlets depend on services provided by the administrative themes. For information on how to assign custom themes to administrative pages, refer to [Customizing the theme](../../../../../build_sites/themes_skins/customizing_theme/index.md).
