# DB2 z/OS: Database transfer

Your portal is installed with an Apache Derby database. The database that is immediately available for use is good for demonstration and portlet and theme development environments. Otherwise, you must configure portal to use a production-level database. Use the Configuration Wizard to transfer the data and configure a new database server.

## Configuration Wizard

The primary Configuration Wizard options are based on your target configuration topology, such as a stand-alone server or a cluster. The database transfer option is included with both **Set Up a Stand-alone Server** and **Set Up a Cluster**. For the stand-alone server topology, run the database transfer option before you run the federated security option. For the cluster option, run the database transfer before you create your deployment manager profile.

For the **Do you want to transfer to one database or multiple databases or schemas** option, select **Single database** to configure one database with a single database user and a single data source. Select **Multiple databases or schemas** to configure multiple databases with different data sources and different users per schema. You can also use the multiple database option to configure a single database with different data sources and different users.

## Validation

Prevent a possible database transfer failure by validating your entries in the wizard. When you chose to validate settings for the Database Transfer option, field syntax and database connection validations are performed to prevent a possible failure before you run the configuration. Examples of fields that are validated include host name and port number. Examples of fields that are validated include database URL and database library fields.

Two types of validation are performed when you select to validate settings including field syntax and database connection validations.

Syntax validation checks that you:

-   Enter a valid port number in the range of 1 - 65535.
-   Use the correct format for your host name.
-   Enter a valid context root value
-   Use the correct JDBC format in the database URL fields.
-   Enter the correct path for your database library jar files.

The database connection validation checks that a connection can be made to your database server. The wizard can connect to your database server to validate the host name and port number values that you enter.

On the Database Settings panel, you can choose to turn validation on or off by selecting **Yes** or **No** to the **Connect to database server to validate settings** option. Select **No**, if you know that your parameters are correct and your database server is unavailable at the time of creating your instructions.

## Transferring data to a different database server

Depending on your environment, the wizard generates a configuration process. The following steps reflect all possible steps in the configuration process. The steps do not represent a literal configuration. The steps are provided as a reference.

## What to do next

You transferred your data from Apache Derby to your preferred database.

One quick way to test your database configuration is to log in and explore the site to validate the site is working as you expected.

Go to http://host_name:port/context_root/default_portal_home. For example, go to http://host_name:10039/wps/portal.

Next, you can use other options to configure your environment more.

If you are setting up a stand-alone server environment, you can use the Enable Federated Security option to add an LDAP user registry.

If you are setting up a cluster environment, you can use the Create a Deployment Manager option to create a deployment manager profile that is augmented with HCL Portal resources.
